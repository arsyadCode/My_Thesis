This paper presents a cross-platform game for learning CT anywhere and anytime using a computer or smartphone with or without internet connection. The game provides an easy-to-use visual programming environment for learners to instruct virtual 3D robot(s) to complete specific tasks. Our game levels are designed to cover these CT core elements: reformulation, recursion, decomposition, abstraction, and systematic testing. The game also supports collaborative learning for multiple learners, where learners find suitable solutions together. This helps to develop their communication and leadership skills. Two surveys were performed to confirm the successful integration of the five CT core elements in its game design, and its attractiveness and usefulness as a CT learning tool.

Evidence in the literature indicates that the development of gamified mobile health applications has not taken into account the user's profile in order to correctly use the game elements in the solution; there also cases in which the use of gamification goes beyond the main purpose of the application, which is to treat health. This results in inefficiency in the use of the gamification strategy. To overcome this problem, this paper presents a gamification-based Framework, called Framework L, a method which incorporates concepts and practices in terms of two dimensions, Self-Care and Gamification, so that an mobile health application developer can design his application. In this context, adaptive gamification experiments were carried out in different ways. The first aims to improve the user experience when performing a manual test for the player profile. The second experiment uses machine learning to classify the user by player profile. These aspects make up the adaptive gamification cycle. The framework evaluation used the mixed method composed of a questionnaire and an online interview with experts. The results indicate that the framework helps developers marshal mobile health applications, primarily by encouraging user engagement. © 2020 IEEE.",Development; Engagement; Gamification; Motivation; Self-care,mHealth; Surveys; User experience; Framework evaluation; Game elements; Mixed method; Mobile health application; Online interviews; Two-dimension; User engagement; User's profiles; Gamification,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,YES,Classification,mengklasifikasi profil karakter pengguna gamifikasi,,,,,,,,

However, it is usually performed using paper-based assessment, which can be frustrating and unengaging for patients. Low engagement can lead to inaccuracies and anomalous results. This paper aims to address this issue by taking a gamified approach to cognitive assessment. Using a physical prototype of a wack-a-mole inspired game, we accurately predicted cognitive ability of players using an SVR Machine Learning model.

In this paper, we describe a set of experiments that use gamification techniques to transform this labelling task into an interactive learning process where users can cooperate in order to achieve a common goal. To this end, first we use a geometrical interpretation of Naïve Bayes (NB) classifiers in order to create an intuitive visualization of the current state of the system and let the user change some of the parameters directly as part of a game. We apply this visualization technique to the classification of newswire and we report the results of the experiments conducted with different groups of people: PhD students, Master Degree students and general public.

Indoor navigation is a complex task for the visually challenged as well as for the general public, especially in large structures like malls, airports, museums, factories, etc. Present solutions and technologies are not cost-effective as well as complex. Hence, we are proposing a low-cost model that uses Augmented Reality to place virtual anchors across a structure, so a person can navigate from one location to another with the help of these anchors. The model doesn't use technologies like GPS. Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence but here, the anchors placed are pervasive and persistent across the indoor environment for smooth navigation. Once placed, these virtual anchors remain at their location and can be used at any time by any person registered on our app. This model can be extended for the general public in any indoor space and also can be enhanced by gamification for better user interaction and retention. This model can also be extended to collaborate with the Aarogya Setu app, which can help us identify routes that go through spaces through which covid positive patients have passed which in turn helps us avoid those routes in real-time navigation. © 2020 IEEE.",Augmented reality; Blind Navigation; Covid-19; GPS; Indoor Navigation; Mixed Reality; Unity; Vector Mapping,Anchors; Artificial intelligence; Augmented reality; Cost effectiveness; Costs; Decision support systems; Location; Navigation; Augmented reality systems; General publics; In-door navigations; Indoor environment; Large structures; Outdoor navigation; Real-time navigation; User interaction; Indoor positioning systems,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,NO,,,,,,,,,,

Software testing is a continuous cycle layered with several stages and spanning across multiple types of testing. Teams need to design test suites and implement test execution methodologies in each stage of development. For this reason, software testing teams comprise many individuals skilled in different aspects of software testing. The inclusion of gamification in this course can lead to positive benefits based on the idea that it is used to influence behavior. This paper presents an preliminary study of Machine Learning (ML) approach for predicting performance gamification of software tester specialists under a gamified testing environment. ImonaGame is a software company that delivers gamification as a service for software testing team of 30 members with different static and dynamic data. User behavior collected in dynamic data sets was classified into categories by deconstructing complex activities into behavior chains using supervision of domain experts. The classification approach was centered on the system's testing processes' performance objectives and potential for encouragement or dissuasion. Motivators and obstacles for the target activity and its behaviors will be found when the model has been developed. After conducting preliminary research, it is possible to determine whether gameful design is an effective and efficient tactic for achieving the desired result by analyzing needs, motives, and obstacles. The source data was classified target data in four categories such as I: Static feature (personal information; 4), II: Daily feature (gamification elements; 14), III: Mission feature (points; 7 sources) and IV: Cumulative futures (Sum of daily and mission features; 13).  © 2022 IEEE.",gamification; machine learning; performance; software tester,Behavioral research; Machine learning; Software design; Classifieds; Design tests; Gamification; Health care education; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Performance; Software tester; Software testings; Testing teams; Software testing,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,YES,Classification,,,,,,,,,

Within AI, Machine Learning (ML) is one of the most prominent sub-fields, the popularity of which is complemented with its high demand as a professional skill for different industries. In the last few years, teaching ML is thus increasingly common in different levels of education. However, the curricula implemented for several courses or programs to learn ML are not always appropriate for the backgrounds of students, particularly high school students, as programming and complex math experience are usually required to implement ML models and understand the potential of this field. For this reason, it is possible for students to have difficulties with the lack of experience required or expected and to have prior to learning ML topics. In addition, motivation can be affected, as the curriculum does not sufficiently engage the student in the learning process. In this work, we propose a visualization tool to introduce high school students to the ML field, which will be implemented using concepts of gamification and adapting the content of the curriculum without requiring exhaustive experience in programming or math.  © 2020 IEEE.",Artificial Intelligence; Education; Gamification; Machine Learning; Visualization.,Curricula; Education computing; Industrial research; Machine learning; Visualization; Education tool; High demand; High school; High school students; Learning process; Professional skills; Research topics; Visualization tools; Students,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,YES,,pengenalan algoritma machine learning berbasis gamifikasi,,,,,,,,

We introduce a quantitative approach that calculates the probability of performing certain cyber security actions and match them to well-known hackers ranks. The calculated probabilities are used to design a special-purpose system that measures the hackers' skills level and rank them. Our system uses a machine-learning approach - it starts with statistically calculated or observed initial values, then it can be trained using data generated either by calculating a weighted sum using a neural networks or by further statistics-based estimation and observation. The initial values were gathered and calculated against the participants of a number of hacking competitions. The probabilistic system is controlled in a manner that it allows the admin/owner to design tasks and challenges with a specific difficulty to examine the systems users skills. Alternatively, it can be designed in an open-end manner which can rank the user's skill based on the level reached.

Another element involved in a city is the user who lives in that place; there is an interaction between the community, buildings, users, and the software and hardware technology. Consequently, social interaction in users plays a primary role in understanding and knowing the user's patterns and profile them and how they interact in the building, the community, and the city.

Emotions such as confusion, boredom and frustration in the student are important factors in determining whether the student will master the exercise of learning to program in the short and long term. Motivation also plays an important role in learning a programing language. However, it is extremely difficult to motivate students who find themselves in a negative emotional state. We developed an advanced learning environment that detects and responds to student emotions by using machine learning techniques, and incorporates modern motivation strategies by using gamification methods. We conducted two experiments; one to evaluate the acceptance of the learning system and a second one to evaluate the academic performance. The results of the experiments show that intention to use is dependent on perceived enjoyment but not on perceived usefulness and attitude toward the system. Also, better results were obtained in a post-test from students who used the learning system, compared with those who didn’t use it. © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Affective computing; computer programming learning; gamification; intelligent learning environment; intelligent tutoring systems,,Routledge,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,YES,Classification,Mendeteksi emosi dan merespon emosi,,,,,,,,

Methods: In 2013–2014, 501 Australian adults aged 18+ years were randomized into a video-tailored intervention, text-tailored intervention, or control group. Over 3 months, the intervention groups received access to 8 sessions of personally tailored PA advice delivered via the TaylorActive website. Only the delivery method differed between the intervention groups: video-tailored vs. text-tailored. Google Analytics and telephone surveys conducted at post intervention (3 months) were used to assess intervention usage, acceptability, usability, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction. Quantitative and qualitative process data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and thematic content analysis. Results: Of 501 recruited adults, 259 completed the 3-month post-intervention survey (52% retention). Overall, usage of the TaylorActive website with respect to number of website visits, intervention sessions, and action plans completed was modest in both the video-tailored (7.6 ± 7.2 visits, mean ± SD) and text-tailored (7.3 ± 5.4 visits) groups with no significant between-group differences. The majority of participants in all groups used the TaylorActive website less than once in 2 weeks (66.7% video-tailored, 62.7% text-tailored, 87.5% control; p < 0.001). Acceptability was rated mostly high in all groups and, in some instances, significantly higher in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p < 0.010). Usability was also rated high; mean Systems Usability Scores were 77.3 (video-tailored), 75.7 (text-tailored), and 74.1 (control) with no significant between-group differences. Perceived usefulness of the TaylorActive intervention was low, though mostly rated higher in the intervention groups compared to the control group (p < 0.010). Satisfaction with the TaylorActive website was mixed. Participants in both intervention groups liked its ease of use, personalized feedback, and tracking of progress, but also found completing action plans and survey questions for each session repetitive and tedious. Conclusion: Providing personally tailored PA advice on its own (through either video or text) is likely insufficient to ensure good retention, usage, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction with a web-based PA intervention. Strategies to address this may include the incorporation of additional intervention components such as activity trackers, social interactions, gamification, as well as the use of advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to allow more personalized dialogue with participants. © 2021",Online; Physical activity; Process evaluation; Program; Video-based,Adolescent; Adult; Artificial Intelligence; Australia; Exercise; Humans; Internet; Personal Satisfaction; adult; aged; Article; Australian; controlled study; feedback system; female; health behavior; human; machine learning; major clinical study; male; middle aged; online system; physical activity; randomized controlled trial; satisfaction; Social Cognitive Theory; telephone interview; Theory of Planned Behavior; usability; videorecording; adolescent; artificial intelligence; Australia; exercise; Internet,Elsevier B.V.,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,NO,,,,,,,,,,

Current cognitive rehabilitation therapy has been shown to be the most effective way to address this problem. However, a) it is not adaptive for every patient, b) it has a high cost, and c) it is usually implemented in clinical environments. The Task Generator (TG) is a free tool for the generation of cognitive training tasks. However, TG is not designed to adapt and monitor the cognitive progress of the patient. Hence, we propose in the BRaNT project an enhancement of TG with belief revision and machine learning techniques, gamification and remote monitoring capabilities to enable health professionals to provide a long-term personalized cognitive rehabilitation therapy at home. The BRaNT is an interdisciplinary effort that addresses scientific limitations of current practices as well as provides solutions towards the sustainability of health systems and contributes towards the improvement of quality of life of patients.

This research proposes an analysis of student engagement in a hybrid virtual lecture in order to identify if interventions are required to support the learning environment. Engagement metrics such as skills, emotional and performance and participation are identified from the student course engagement questionnaire. Students that have disengaged from the course are given interventions such as interactive digital elements, feedback, direct communication, and group activities. Results demonstrate that emotional engagement has a high focus during the assessment periods representing affective engagement of student feelings, attitudes, and perceptions towards the learning. In response the lecture was adjusted to include emotional interactions such as activities in which students relate course concepts to personal development.

This is in part related to a lack of practical and easy to administer screening strategies that can identify and help triage cognitive impairment. This study explores how smartphone-based assessments may help address this need. Methods: In this study, data was analyzed from 25 subjects with schizophrenia and 30 controls who engaged with a gamified mobile phone version of the Trails-B cognitive assessment in their everyday life over 90 days and complete a clinical neurocognitive testing battery at the beginning and end of the study. Machine learning was applied to the resulting dataset to predict disease status and neurocognitive function and understand which features were most important for accurate prediction. Results: The generated models predicted disease status with high accuracy using static features alone (AUC = 0.94), with the total number of items collected and the total duration of interaction with the application most predictive. The addition of temporal data statistically significantly improved performance (AUC = 0.95), with the amount of idle time a significant new predictor. Correlates of sleep dysfunction were also predicted (AUC = 0.80), with similar feature importance. Discussion: Machine learning enabled the highly accurate identification of subjects with schizophrenia versus healthy controls, and the accurate prediction of neurocognitive function. The addition of temporal data significantly improved the performance of these models, underscoring the value of smartphone-based assessments of cognition as a practical tool for assessing cognition. © 2021",Digital psychiatry; Gamification; Machine learning; Schizophrenia,Article; cognition; cognition assessment; cognitive defect; controlled study; depression; Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7; human; machine learning; major clinical study; mental disease; mobile application; neuropsychological test; Patient Health Questionnaire 9; Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; prediction; principal component analysis; psychiatry; questionnaire; schizophrenia; scoring system; sleep quality; verbal memory,Elsevier Inc.,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,YES,Classification,mengolah data yang diperoleh dari gamifikasi untuk memprediksi status penyakit skizo yang diderita pasien,,,,,,,,

This article addresses these issues by introducing the agrochemical pervasive traceability model (APTM), which integrates machine learning, sensors, microcontrollers, gamification, and two blockchains. It contributes in two dimensions: (I) the study of the environmental, product piracy and regulatory of agrochemical control; (II) the technological dimension: application of an adequate set of sensors collecting multiple data; modeling and implementation of a system via machine learning for analyzing and predicting the behavior and use of agrochemicals; development of a scoring system via gamification for reverse use of agrochemicals; and presenting a record of transactions in a consortium of two blockchains, simultaneously. Its main advantage is to be a flexible, adaptable, and expansive model. Results indicated that the model has positive aspects, from detecting the agrochemical, its handling, and disposal, recording of transactions, and data visualization along the reverse supply chain. This study obtained a round trip time of 0.510 ms on average; data transfers between layer one and its persistence in the database were between 4 to 5 s. Thus, blockchain nodes consumed only 34 to 38% of CPU and recorded transactions between 2 to 4 s. These results point to a horizon of applicability in real situations within agricultural farms. © 2021 by the authors.

To address these problems, detection is required. Current assessment tools are time-consuming, require a trained supervisor, and are not motivating for children. Sensor-augmented toys and machine learning have been presented as possible solutions to address this problem. Objective: This study examines whether sensor-augmented toys can be used to assess children's fine motor skills. The objectives were to (1) predict the outcome of the fine motor skill part of the Movement Assessment Battery for Children Second Edition (fine MABC-2) and (2) study the influence of the classification model, game, type of data, and level of difficulty of the game on the prediction. Methods: Children in elementary school (n=95, age 7.8 [SD 0.7] years) performed the fine MABC-2 and played 2 games with a sensor-augmented toy called “Futuro Cube.” The game “roadrunner” focused on speed while the game “maze” focused on precision. Each game had several levels of difficulty. While playing, both sensor and game data were collected. Four supervised machine learning classifiers were trained with these data to predict the fine MABC-2 outcome: k-nearest neighbor (KNN), logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), and support vector machine (SVM). First, we compared the performances of the games and classifiers. Subsequently, we compared the levels of difficulty and types of data for the classifier and game that performed best on accuracy and F1 score. For all statistical tests, we used α=.05. Results: The highest achieved mean accuracy (0.76) was achieved with the DT classifier that was trained on both sensor and game data obtained from playing the easiest and the hardest level of the roadrunner game. Significant differences in performance were found in the accuracy scores between data obtained from the roadrunner and maze games (DT, P=.03; KNN, P=.01; LR, P=.02; SVM, P=.04). No significant differences in performance were found in the accuracy scores between the best performing classifier and the other 3 classifiers for both the roadrunner game (DT vs KNN, P=.42; DT vs LR, P=.35; DT vs SVM, P=.08) and the maze game (DT vs KNN, P=.15; DT vs LR, P=.62; DT vs SVM, P=.26). The accuracy of only the best performing level of difficulty (combination of the easiest and hardest level) achieved with the DT classifier trained with sensor and game data obtained from the roadrunner game was significantly better than the combination of the easiest and middle level (P=.046). Conclusions: The results of our study show that sensor-augmented toys can efficiently predict the fine MABC-2 scores for children in elementary school. Selecting the game type (focusing on speed or precision) and data type (sensor or game data) is more important for determining the performance than selecting the machine learning classifier or level of difficulty. © Annette Brons, Antoine de Schipper, Svetlana Mironcika, Huub Toussaint, Ben Schouten, Sander Bakkes, Ben Kröse.

Intellectual Disability is characterized by below-average intelligence. Children with Intellectual Disability can do and learn new skills, but they learn them more slowly than average children of their age. Game-based learning is an effective way of getting learners actively involved in educational activities. Educating children with Intellectual Disability is a challenging process. They usually learn and progress more slowly than average children. Such children may have issues with motivation and interest in education; the use of Gamification approach becomes important as a motivational and interested affordance. A prototype desktop Gamification Supportive Tool called 'ATHWELA' is proposed which operates through Assistive Technology. Assistive technology can be a device or a service that is used to increase, maintain, or improve functional capabilities of individuals with disabilities. Children with Intellectual Disability can be less interested in Mathematics, some can be not good in reading and some can be not good in writing. ATHWELA is targeting at increasing, maintaining, or improving these three points and ATHWELA can be used in special education classrooms as a tool of gratification and extrinsic motivation. Points and rewards will be presented as the motivational technique. The main objective of our research is to help children with Intellectual Disability with their primary educational skills with less effort and in an interactive way and this prototype desktop application is developed in the Sinhala language because the Sinhala is the mother-tongue of Sri Lanka.

Such assessment tools are adequate for human resources seeking tools to assess a large volume of diverse player personalities in the current ""war of talents."" Recently, studies about using Gamified situational judgment test approaches have shown positive results in assessing players' behavior and personality. Gamified situational judgment tests combine the advantages of gamification, such as enhancing players' reactions and flow state, with the acknowledged traditional situational judgment test approach. To gamify a situational judgment test, an innovative approach using the visual novel game genre has shown positive results in the gamification by adding game elements such as narrative scripts, non-player characters, dialogs, and audiovisual assets to the test. Indeed, these elements play an essential role in the validity of the players' personality results by using a stealth-assessment method to minimize social bias and player's stress. However, to our knowledge, as gamification in personality detection is still recent, little is known on the possible positive outcomes of designing game elements such as the dialogues and non-player character personalities in the validity of the team cohesion measure. To this end, we propose an empirical study to build personality trait models based on non-players characters' speeches. We used the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator based on four dichotomies to classify the personalities as one of companies and organizations' most used personality typology. For each of the four dimensions, we train twenty-four separate binary classifiers and one 16-class classifier, using well-established machine learning and a convolutional neural network in the domain of natural language processing, text analytics, and computational psychometrics. The results of this study show that it is possible to recognize non-playable characters' personalities and thus can help game designers to understand their characters' personalities using natural language processing. © 2022 Dechema e.V..

The treatment of AD is based on drugs, which must be administered in the early stages of the development of the disease. Therefore, early diagnosis of the disease is of great significance for the efficiency of the treatment. AD is currently diagnosed by the provision of a professional, conducting medical tests, which is not easily accessible. In this paper, we introduce Caregiver, an application that takes initiative by administering Clock Drawing Test (CDT) on mobile devices and facilitates administration of the test in a fun and simple digital environment. Caregiver gives suggestions to its users to seek professional help for treatment of AD based on the score they get from computer feedback on the clock drawings. Conducting the CDT step by step through gamification, Caregiver provides essential healthcare to people that don’t have access to medical faculties. Saving its users data, Caregiver also provides an insight on the progression of the cognitive impairment if present. Its user-friendly interface enables its users to actively interact with the application and obtain more accurate results than conducting the test by themselves. Caregiver evaluates visual inputs of the test using a weighted combination of two different classification models, which decreases the total time to conduct the test, hence providing early diagnosis. © The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Accessibility; Alzheimer’s disease; Artificial intelligence; Clock-drawing test; Early diagnosis; Human centered computing; Human computer interaction; Machine learning; Mobile application,Clocks; Diagnosis; Digital devices; Human computer interaction; mHealth; Neurodegenerative diseases; Accessibility; Alzheimer; Alzheimer’s disease; Clock-drawing test; Early diagnosis; Human-centered computing; Machine-learning; Mobile applications; Neurodegenerative disorders; Simple++; Machine learning,Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,YES,Classification,"evaluasi skor dari hasil input penerapan CDT, lalu menentukan saran untuk perawatan lebih lanjut terkait Alzheimer Disease berdasarkan skor yang diperoleh",,,,,,,,

The gamified approach targets patients experiencing upper-limb movement hindrances, typically caused by neuromuscular disorders. The leap motion controller is used for interaction. The game guides the avatar to move along the X and Y axis following specific paths. The avatar mimics the movement of the user's hand that performs these movements for rehabilitation. In order to use this method for the training and assessment patient’s motion, a quantified approach that uses the game-based motion for patient assessment is required. Besides simple game scores that are often used, the proposed data analysis aims to elaborate on the discrimination between pathological and healthy movement with a machine learning approach, as well as the quantification of the patient’s progress over time. For this purpose, movement and performance-related features were extracted from the leap sensor recordings and their value was explored towards characterizing the patient state and progress in detail. A dataset with multiple recordings from patients and healthy individuals was used for this purpose. All patients suffered from neuromuscular disorders. The features with the highest discriminatory value between the two groups were subsequently used to develop a set of classifiers for different sets of movements (e.g., horizontal, diagonal, vertical). A patient was left out of the classifier creation procedure and used for external validation. The models achieved high accuracy (92.13%). These results are deemed promising for the quantification of a patient’s progress. Copyright © 2021 by SCITEPRESS – Science and Technology Publications, Lda.

The Cosmic Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO) experiment is designed for the large-scale study of various radiation forms that contin-uously reach the Earth from space, collectively known as cosmic rays. The CREDO Detector app relies on a network of involved users and is now working worldwide across phones and other CMOS sensor-equipped devices. To broaden the user base and activate current users, CREDO extensively uses the gamification solutions like the periodical Particle Hunters Competition. However, the adverse effect of gamification is that the number of artefacts, i.e., signals unrelated to cosmic ray detection or openly related to cheating, substantially increases. To tag the artefacts appearing in the CREDO database we propose the method based on machine learning. The approach involves training the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to recognise the morphological difference between signals and artefacts. As a result we obtain the CNN-based trigger which is able to mimic the signal vs. artefact assignments of human annotators as closely as possible. To enhance the method, the input image signal is adaptively thresholded and then transformed using Daubechies wavelets. In this exploratory study, we use wavelet transforms to amplify distinctive image features. As a result, we obtain a very good recognition ratio of almost 99% for both signal and artefacts. The proposed solution allows eliminating the manual supervision of the competition process. © 2021 by the authors.

One important strategy for this context is personalized gamification. We investigate how a personalized gamified energy saving application can be designed based on individual preferences within the context of an energy supplier. To design a personalized gamification application the proposed method of Knutas et al. was adapted by leaving out the parts about machine learning and adding an evaluation phase. We show that customization by users can be a valuable alternative for using machine learning personalization strategies. We used this iterative design process to focus on personalizing, in this use case for the three main user types of the customer base of a Dutch energy supplier. The design of the gamified application was adapted using feedback of both stakeholders and customers using interviews and focus groups. This resulted in two final designs designed to stimulate energy saving behaviour among customers. The design had a dashboard which allowed for personalization within gamified elements, and an energy editor in which users can change characteristics in their households to learn about the effects of actions on their energy consumption. These two final designs were validated using an interactive prototype along with interviews. The added value of this study is that it shows that the Hexad framework with its proposed gamification user types is suitable to understand the main motivations of a target group. Results suggest that designing within gamified mechanics based on a user type's main motivation is an effective strategy for personalization. Motivation-based design is not the only successful personalization design strategy but adapting designs to personal situation and existing energy saving behaviour might also motivate users. © 2022 Dechema e.V..

Although in-vehicle interventions and gamification features in post-trip dashboards have emerged, the connection between real-time driving behavior prediction and the triggering of such interventions is yet to be realized. This is the focus of the European Horizon2020 project “i-DREAMS”, which aims at defining, developing, testing and validating a ‘Safety Tolerance Zone’ (STZ) in order to prevent drivers from risky driving behaviors using interventions both in real-time and post-trip. However, the data-driven conceptualization of STZ levels is a challenging task, and data class imbalance might hinder this process. Following the project principles and taking the aforementioned challenges into consideration, this paper proposes a framework to identify the level of risky driving behavior as well as the duration of the time spent in each risk level by private car drivers. This aim is accomplished by four classification algorithms, namely Support Vector Machines (SVMs), Random Forest (RFs), AdaBoost, and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) Neural Networks and imbalanced learning using the Adaptive Synthetic technique (ADASYN) in order to deal with the unbalanced distribution of the dataset in the STZ levels. Moreover, as an alternative approach of risk prediction, three regression algorithms, namely Ridge, Lasso, and Elastic Net are used to predict time duration. The results showed that RF and MLP outperformed the rest of the classifiers with 84% and 82% overall accuracy, respectively, and that the maximum speed of the vehicle during a 30 s interval, is the most crucial predictor for identifying the driving time at each safety level. © 2022 by the authors.",driving behavior analysis; driving behavior classification; imbalanced machine learning,"Accidents, Traffic; Automobile Driving; Machine Learning; Neural Networks, Computer; Support Vector Machine; Adaptive boosting; Classification (of information); Decision trees; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Random forests; Safety engineering; Safety testing; Support vector machines; Behavior analysis; Behaviour classification; Driving behavior analyse; Driving behavior classification; Driving behaviour; Imbalanced machine learning; Machine-learning; Real- time; Tolerance zones; car driving; machine learning; prevention and control; support vector machine; traffic accident; Multilayer neural networks",MDPI,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,YES,,tidak disebutkan mengenai bagian dari gamifikasi,,,,,,,,

Early detection of dyslexia is the foundation for early intervention, which is the key to reduce the adverse effects of dyslexia, e.g., bad school grades. In this paper, we present the prototype of a puzzle app, which we explicitly designed with the human-centred design (HCD) process for dyslexia screening in pre-reader using new indicators related to motor skills to ensure users needs for the data collection to apply machine learning prediction. The app records the telemetry of the gaming sequence in order to derive future statements about the prevalence of dyslexia based on the telemetry data. The high-fidelity prototype was evaluated with a five-user test usability study with five German-speaking child-parent pairs. The results show how young children and parents are interacting with new games, and how new applications (web and mobile technologies) which are used for online experiments, could be developed.

However, current personalisation relies primarily on user types identified through self-reporting rather than actual behaviour. As a novel approach, the present study used an exploratory machine learning analysis to identify seven clusters of users in a gamified fitness application based on their behavioural data (N = 19,576). The clusters were then conceptually compared to common user typologies in gamification, identifying possible relationships between behavioural user clusters and user types motivated by achievement, sociability, and extrinsic incentives. The findings shed light on nuanced behaviour patterns of user types in the fitness context and how knowing these patterns can inform the way in which tailored gamification could be implemented to meet the needs of specific types. Thereby, they contribute to the discussion on utilising behavioural data and user typologies for tailored gamification design. © 2022 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

Moreover, without obstructing the ongoing operations, DTs also provide an assessment platform for evaluating the operational behavior and security of the CPS. Therefore, they become a potential source of data breaches and a broad attack surface for attackers to launch covert attacks. To detect and mitigate security loopholes in DTs, one of the potential solutions is to leverage a gamification approach that can assess the security level of DTs while providing security analysts with a controlled and supportive virtual training environment. Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-based approaches can complement the idea of security orchestration and automation in the gamification approach. However, AI/ML-based DTs security solutions are generally constrained by the lack of transparency of AI operations, which results in less confidence in the decisions made by the AI models. To address the explainable security challenges of DTs, this article proposes a gamification approach called sEcuriNg dIgital twins through GaMification Approach (ENIGMA). While leveraging DTs as an offensive security platform, ENIGMA provides gaming scenarios to assess DTs’ security and train security analysts. The game players within ENIGMA are humans (the attacker team) and AI agents (the defender team). Furthermore, ENIGMA is supported by an eXplainable AI (XAI)-based DT security assessment model that explains the decisions made based on the SHAP values by the AI model on attack vectors for the defender team, i.e., the AI agent.

We discuss the validation of an all-digital, ecological and non-intrusive e-health application for the early detection of cognitive impairment, based on artificial intelligence for patient classification, and more specifically on machine learning algorithms. To evaluate the discrimination power of this application, a cross-sectional pilot study was carried out involving 30 subjects: 10 health control subjects (mean age: 75.62 years); 14 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (mean age: 81.24 years) and 6 early-stage Alzheimer’s patients (mean age: 80.44 years). The study was carried out in two separate sessions in November 2021 and January 2022. All participants completed the study, and no concerns were raised about the acceptability of the test. Analysis including socio-demographics and game data supports the prediction of participants’ cognitive status using machine learning algorithms. According to the performance metrics computed, best classification results are obtained a Multilayer Perceptron classifier, Support Vector Machines and Random Forest, respectively, with weighted recall values >= 0.9784 ± 0.0265 and F1-score = 0.9764 ± 0.0291. Furthermore, thanks to hyper-parameter optimization, false negative rates were dramatically reduced. Shapley’s additive planning (SHAP) applied according to the eXplicable AI (XAI) method, made it possible to visually and quantitatively evaluate the importance of the different features in the final classification. This is a relevant step ahead towards the use of machine learning and gamification to early detect cognitive impairment. In addition, this tool was designed to support self-administration, which could be a relevant aspect in confinement situations with limited access to health professionals. However, further research is required to identify patterns that may help to predict or estimate future cognitive damage and normative data. © 2022 by the authors.",cognitive impairment; early detection; eXplicable AI (XAI); gamification; machine learning algorithms; non-intrusive assessment,,MDPI,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,YES,Classification,tidak disebutkan mengenai bagian dari gamifikasi,,,,,,,,

Existing blockchain-based solutions are generally not of industrial strength, where limitations include scalability and lack of engagement by participating clients. In this article, blockchain-in-the-loop FL is our proposed approach of intertwining classic FL and Hyperledger Fabric with a gamification component.

The enterprise-level blockchain network provides an immutable ledger that can be leveraged at different FL layers to ensure auditable tracing and level-up security in industrial settings.

The lack of self-motivation and intermittent engagement is one of the prime challenges faced by educators today. Perplexing tasks for the faculty are to embroil students during the lecture. This work paves new ways to scale up the enticement using artificial intelligence and machine learning. The intelligent framework proposed here is built on yet another novel methodology used globally for user engagement and is termed gamification. The primary objective of the present research work is to negate the issue of disengagement by designing and implementing a gamified framework on 120 students from higher education that will include student engagement, enticement, and motivation. Generally, mechanisms are designed for specific courses, whereas the gamified system proposed is an open-ended method irrespective of course and the program being studied, and this framework has endeavored on multiple courses. To enhance the utility of the gamified framework, ANFIS model is utilized for smart decision-making concerning rewards distribution that is directly proportional to the number of coins gained by the students. As an outcome, better participation of a group of students under the proposed intelligent gamified system is reported as compared to the control group thus endorsing the success of the model.  © 2021 Kavisha Duggal et al.",,Decision making; Gamification; Machine learning; Motivation; Students; Teaching; Higher education; Multiple course; Novel methodology; Primary objective; Self-motivations; Student engagement; Teaching and learning; User engagement; Education computing,Hindawi Limited,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,YES,,,,,,,,,,

First, we provide a thorough comparison and new insight over different notions of optimality in the linear case, including G-optimality, transductive optimality from optimal experimental design and asymptotic optimality. Second, we design the first asymptotically optimal algorithm for fixedconfidence pure exploration in linear bandits. As a consequence, our algorithm naturally bypasses the pitfall caused by a simple but difficult instance, that most prior algorithms had to be engineered to deal with explicitly.

Nowadays, different industries employ a variety of applications based on gamification to create coherent and effective teams, e.g., by assigning roles based on the knowledge, understanding, and relationships between members. In this paper, we explore an online Escape Room experience that incorporates a variety of Raven-inspired intelligence tests and team-members communication, combined with Machine Learning methods. More particularly, we implemented state-of-the-art Deep Reinforcement Learning (Deep RL) agents, which are used for emulating human-like behaviour to navigate and interact with the 3D rooms, as well as to solve the tests. The RL agents simulate behavioural elements based on OCEAN personality traits model, such as openness, conscientiousness, and neuroticism, while also generating a big number of gameplay data. Analysis shows that their particular behavioural patterns have a significant effect on their performance, stability and time required to solve tasks. These findings allowed us to produce new performance metrics for a generic escape room model, which can categorize human play styles according to the OCEAN Five personality trait model. This approach effectively analyses the teams' behaviour concerning both individual and overall performance. © The Authors, 2021.

Since skilled surgeons are too busy to spend much time with novice surgeons, novice surgeons need to train alone in monotonous tasks to acquire skills. To address this problem, this study proposes a system that incorporates gamification elements, such as scoring and displaying real-time feedback, to improve motivation for training. This system detects the technical factors necessary for microscopic suturing from video capture, and calculates a score using these factors. According to neurosurgeons, suturing has three important factors: speed, accuracy, and carefulness. These technical factors are detected by tracking instruments and gauze using machine learning and image processing. The experiment was conducted with ten novices using this system. The results of this experiment showed that the system is easy to use and contributed to increased motivation, according to the User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) and System Usability Scale (SUS).  © 2023 ACM.",CV-based tracking; Gamification; Neurosurgical training; Real-time feedback; Visual feedback,Image processing; Motivation; User interfaces; Visual communication; CV-based tracking; Gamification; Machine-learning; Medical techniques; Neurosurgical training; Real-time feedback; Speed accuracy; Technical factors; Video capture; Visual feedback; Neurosurgery,Association for Computing Machinery,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

With our work we aim to gain explainability focussing on correlation clustering and try to pursue the original goals of different Data Science tasks,: Extracting knowledge from data. As well-known tools like Fold-It or GeoTime show, gamification is a very mighty approach, but not only to solve tasks which prove more difficult for machines than for humans. We could also gain knowledge from how players proceed trying to solve those difficult tasks. That is why we developed Straighten it up!, a game in which users try to find the best linear correlations in high dimensional datasets. Finding arbitrarily oriented subspaces in high dimensional data is an exponentially complex task due to the number of potential subspaces in regards to the number of dimensions. Nevertheless, linearly correlated points are as a simple pattern easy to track by the human eye. Straighten it up! gives users an overview over two-dimensional projections of a self-chosen dataset. Users decide which subspace they want to examine first, and can draw in arbitrarily many lines fitting the data. An offset inside of which points are assigned to the corresponding line can easily be chosen for every line independently, and users can switch between different projections at any time. We developed a scoring system not only as incentive, but first of all for further examination, based on the density of each cluster, its minimum spanning tree, size of offset, and coverage. By tracking every step of a user we are able to detect common mechanisms and examine differences to state-of-the-art correlation and subspace clustering algorithms, resulting in more comprehensibility. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",,Data Science; Human computer interaction; Correlation clustering; High dimensional data; High dimensional datasets; Linear correlation; Minimum spanning trees; Scoring systems; State of the art; Two-dimensional projection; Clustering algorithms,Springer Verlag,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Involving a human user during this process can avoid producing theoretically sound solutions that do not translate to the real world but slows down the process and introduces the problem of user fatigue. Gamification can alleviate user boredom, concentrate user attention, or make a complex problem easier to understand. This paper explores the use of gamification as a mechanism to extract problem-solving behaviour from human subjects through interaction with a gamified version of the bin-packing problem, with heuristics extracted by machine learning. The heuristics are then embedded into an evolutionary algorithm through the mutation operator to create a human-guided algorithm. Experimentation demonstrates that good human performers augment EA performance, but that poorer performers can be detrimental to it in certain circumstances. Overall, the introduction of human expertise is seen to benefit the algorithm. © 2019 Copyright is held by the owner/author(s).

The aim of the article is to determine the stages of implementation of business gamification according to various models, describe the existing differences and confront the results with business practice in Poland. To this end, a scoping review on the subject was carried out in terms of the existing methodologies for the implementation of gamification solutions. In the next stage, a scenario was created to conduct individual in-depth interviews (IDI) with companies implementing gamification projects in business. As a result of the research, the practice of implementing business gamification in Poland was described against the background of the methodologies proposed in the literature. This has led to the identification of several significant differences in implementation stages both between theory and practice and among the implementations proposed by the companies participating in the interviews. An attempt was made to explain these differences by taking the type of IT solution as a criterion. © 2020 by the author.",Business gamification; Gamification implementation; Implementation stages,Business practices; Game-Based; In-depth interviews; IT project; IT solution; Scoping review; Theory and practice; Gamification,MDPI AG,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

However, sometimes a human-in-the-loop can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems. In this paper we provide new experimental insights on how we can improve computational intelligence by complementing it with human intelligence in an interactive machine learning approach (iML). For this purpose, we used the Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) framework, because this fosters multi-agent approaches with human agents in the loop. We propose unification between the human intelligence and interaction skills and the computational power of an artificial system. The ACO framework is used on a case study solving the Traveling Salesman Problem, because of its many practical implications, e.g. in the medical domain. We used ACO due to the fact that it is one of the best algorithms used in many applied intelligence problems. For the evaluation we used gamification, i.e. we implemented a snake-like game called Traveling Snakesman with the MAX–MIN Ant System (MMAS) in the background. We extended the MMAS–Algorithm in a way, that the human can directly interact and influence the ants. This is done by “traveling” with the snake across the graph. Each time the human travels over an ant, the current pheromone value of the edge is multiplied by 5. This manipulation has an impact on the ant’s behavior (the probability that this edge is taken by the ant increases). The results show that the humans performing one tour through the graphs have a significant impact on the shortest path found by the MMAS.

To alleviate this problem, we developed a gamified method of acquiring annotated facial emotion data without an explicit labeling effort by humans. The game, which we named Facegame, challenges the players to imitate a displayed image of a face that portrays a particular basic emotion. Every round played by the player creates new data that consists of a set of facial features and landmarks, already annotated with the emotion label of the target facial expression. Such an approach effectively creates a robust, sustainable, and continuous machine learning training process. We evaluated Facegame with an experiment that revealed several contributions to the field of affective computing. First, the gamified data collection approach allowed us to access a rich variation of facial expressions of each basic emotion due to the natural variations in the players' facial expressions and their expressive abilities. We report improved accuracy when the collected data were used to enrich well-known in-the-wild facial emotion datasets and consecutively used for training facial emotion recognition models. Second, the natural language prescription method used by the Facegame constitutes a novel approach for interpretable explainability that can be applied to any facial emotion recog-nition model. Finally, we observed significant improvements in the facial emotion perception and expression skills of the players through repeated game play.  © 2022 IEEE.",Affective computing; explainable AI; facial emotion recognition; gamification; interpretable machine learning,Behavioral research; Data acquisition; Face recognition; Machine learning; Speech recognition; Affective Computing; Data collection; Emotion recognition; Explainable AI; Facial emotion recognition; Facial emotions; Facial Expressions; Gamification; Interpretable machine learning; Machine-learning; Emotion Recognition,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Concurrently, the COVID-19 pandemic has accentuated the demand for strengthening Environmental Education as a means to improve sustainability and stimulate environmental protection and public health. Having in mind that CT does not concern only technocrats but also applies in solving everyday problems, we introduce the novel idea of the synergistic learning of CT and Environmental Study. Thus, our research aim is to explore the correlation between algorithmic thinking (AT), as a fundamental CT competency, and educational achievements in the Environmental Study course during the early primary school years. Towards this end, we implemented a quantitative research study, employing an innovative assessment framework we propose. The adoption of cluster sampling eventuated in a sample of 435 students. The exploitation of ordinal logistic regression analysis and machine learning method validated the correlation of the two fields and pointed out that AT levels constitute a predictive factor for performance in the Environmental Study course and vice versa. These results support the novel idea of concurrently cultivating environmental consciousness and CT and build a robust base for future studies that will focus on providing an ecological reflection on CT activities. © 2022 by the authors.",computational thinking; educational apps; educational methodologies; gamification; STEM; teaching programming,COVID-19; environmental education; machine learning; primary education; regression analysis,MDPI,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Its diagnosis is delayed until the completion of handwriting development. To allow a preventive training program, abilities not directly related to handwriting should be evaluated, and one of them is visual perception. To investigate the role of visual perception in handwriting skills, we gamified standard clinical visual perception tests to be played while wearing an eye tracker at three difficulty levels. Then, we identified children at risk of dysgraphia through the means of a handwriting speed test. Five machine learning models were constructed to predict if the child was at risk, using the CatBoost algorithm with Nested Cross-Validation, with combinations of game performance, eye-tracking, and drawing data as predictors. A total of 53 children participated in the study. The machine learning models obtained good results, particularly with game performances as predictors (F1 score: 0.77 train, 0.71 test). SHAP explainer was used to identify the most impactful features. The game reached an excellent usability score (89.4 ± 9.6).

DeepMind researchers have already implemented model-free RL to play Go and Chess at a superhuman level using neural Monte-Carlo-Tree-Search (neural MCTS). Therefore, it is plausible to consider that RL, starting from zero knowledge, can be applied to other problems which can be converted into games. We try to leverage the computational power of neural MCTS to solve a class of combinatorial optimization problems. Following the idea of Hintikka's Game-Theoretical Semantics, we propose the Zermelo Gamification (ZG) to transform specific combinatorial optimization problems into Zermelo games whose winning strategies correspond to the solutions of the original optimization problem.

The early detection of Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI), which can develop AD, plays a major role in the management of patients to slow the decline in cognitive function, as treatments are effective at an early stage of the disease course. For this purpose, advanced computer technologies can provide a tool for the early detection of AD and prediction of disease progression. This article presents a serious game, including 16 mini-games that aimed at detecting AD or MCI in the mild stage. Based on gamification techniques and machine learning (ML), by overcoming the limitations of traditional tests. This gamified cognitive tool, entitled AlzCoGame, evaluates the main cognitive domains considered to be the most pertinent indicators in diagnosing cognitive impairments: working memory, episodic memory, executive functions, Visio-spatial orientation, concentration, and attention. Results and Conclusion: Six predictive ML models have been implemented using the AlzCoGame dataset. We used the K-fold cross-validation and classification metrics to validate the model's performance. Based on the results of the pilot study, the best overall performance was obtained by the RF classifier with average Sensitivity = 0.89, Specificity = 0.93, Accuracy = 0.92, F1-Score = 0.91, and ROC = 0.91. We can deduce that including machine learning techniques and serious games could help improve certain aspects of the clinical diagnosis of cognitive impairment. Moreover, clinical trials are required to prove the impact of this gamified program on cognitive skills and evaluate usability measures. © The Author(s) 2022.",Alzheimer’s; classification; cognitive stimulation; early diagnosis; gamification; machine learning; serious game,,SAGE Publications Inc.,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we propose the use of a behavioral biometric based approach to authentication that functions by modeling the manner in which users interact wit mobile games, which are one of the most popular uses of mobile devices. We conducted an IRB approved study in which 30 participants were asked to play three popular Android games as well as utilize a mobile touchscreen without any gameplay prompting. We extracted features from users’ touchscreen activity during these interactions, then applied a Support Vector Machine to classify users based on patterns which emerged from their usage during the game.

Although such assessments are starting to gain traction in personnel selection, few studies describing their validity and psychometric properties exist. The current study explores the potential of a five-minute, forced-choice, image-based assessment of the Big Five personality traits to be used in selection.

Therefore, utility companies, governmental agencies, and various other entities with environmental concerns aim at lowering and shaping energy consumption patterns to achieve peak load reduction, load smoothing, and hence carbon emission curtailment. In this survey paper, we present an overview of approaches for engaging smart grid consumers and for providing them with information, motivation, and recommendations for energy efficiency through mobile apps. Our focus is to bring machine learning approaches closer to smart grid mobile apps so as to optimally manage consumer flexibility and enhance energy savings through detailed consumer profiling and modeling, since an increasing amount of energy consumer data is becoming available. A novel survey and analysis of prior work in the area is conducted in order to identify gaps from this perspective. We consider both recent research project outputs and commercial products and we discuss various aspects of the designs, such as state-of-the-art technologies, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation techniques, gamification, consumer profiling, and the role of machine learning and recommender systems in this context. Furthermore, different mobile apps are presented and compared based on the most important features that affect consumer energy efficiency and sustainability, such as data visualization, gamification, flexibility, consumer profiling methods, feedback mechanisms, recommendations, social media, and machine learning integration.

However, an issue of motivating users to participate in crowdsourcing platform stays challenging. We have proposed a new approach, i.e., reinforcement learning-based gamification method to motivate users. Gamification has been a practical approach to engaging users in many fields, but still, it needs an improvement in the Crowdsourcing platform. In this paper, the gamification approach is strengthened by a reinforcement learning algorithm. We have created an intelligent agent using the Reinforcement learning algorithm (Q-learning). This agent suggests an optimal action plan that yields maximum reward points to the users for their active participation in the Crowdsourcing application. Also, its performance is compared with the SARSA algorithm (On-policy learning), which is another Reinforcement learning algorithm. © Research Institute for Intelligent Computer Systems, 2020.",Crowdsourcing; Machine learning; Motivation; Q learning algorithm; Social media,,Research Institute of Intelligent Computer Systems,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

They can make e-learning more personalised and adaptable, providing students with a more engaging and effective learning experience. Design/methodology/approach: The development of LOs and e-pedagogical practices have significantly influenced and changed the performance of e-learning systems. LOs are self-contained, reusable units of instructional content that create instructional materials, such as online courses, tutorials and assessments. They provide a flexible and modular approach to designing and delivering e-learning content, allowing educators to easily customise and adapt their materials to the needs of their students. e-pedagogical practices refer to the use of technology to enhance and support the teaching and learning process. They include strategies such as online collaboration, gamification and adaptive learning to improve student engagement, motivation and achievement. Findings: To achieve this objective, this study consists of two main phases. First, the authors extract metadata from LOs using latent semantic analysis algorithms, which are considered a strong tool in web-mining exploration techniques. Second, they identify LOs according to a particular form of similarity using fuzzy c-means (FCM) algorithms. To improve classification accuracy, the FCM is used as a clustering algorithm. Originality/value: Finally, in order to assess the effectiveness of LOs with FCM, a series of experimental studies using a real-world dataset are conducted. The results of this study indicate that the proposed approach exceeds the traditional approach and produces good results. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Clustering algorithm; Fuzzy c-means; Latent semantic analysis (LSA); Learning objects; Machine learning; Web-based mining techniques,,Emerald Publishing,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

However, issues related to its effectiveness as well as social and psychological implications, remain unresolved. From many sides, there is a desire to go beyond DL, towards a more engaging and efficient experience that takes advantage of the limitless knowledge resources offered by the infosphere. This new type of DL or DL 2.0 integrates different educational modes, beyond the blended approach, following the path of onlife education, without distinction between online and offline. In this context, tools such as Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) could prove to be useful and effective as a complement to DL, a significant step towards onlife learning. In this paper, an ITS solution that led to the implementation of Virtual Study Buddy is proposed, primarily designed to support students in their individual studies, acting as a digital learning assistant.

From education to work to shopping, our activities are tracked, our progress is monitored, and rewards are meted out. But this enforced acceptance of constant surveillance constructs a social narrative in which privacy ceases to exist, and the technological tools at work can easily be shifted from reward to control. This is furthered through the shift from a Bentham–Foucault model of power and the threat of surveillance to the actualisation of complete protocological surveillance enabled by cloud computing, data centres, and machine learning. It is no longer the case that anything we do might be surveilled; we can be fairly certain that everything we do probably is being monitored, judged, and recorded. How can we negotiate these changing narratives? Of what fictions do we convince ourselves when we play the “game” called digital society? This article uses the work of Cory Doctorow, Charles Stross, Dave Eggers, and Ernest Cline to assess how fictionality can act as thought experiments for the social conditions of surveillance technologies. Through stories such as Halting State and Walkaway, we explore the collisions between the control-based society of tech companies and the disciplinary structures of traditional states—the points of tension between illusions of freedom, guided game paths, and the exercise of power over users’ data and behaviours. The article argues for expanding our perspectives on the reach of game analysis to the broader connected networks of cultural and political systems, to assess ways of responding to the idea that we are being played with, turned into characters in the gamified narratives of control-based surveillance societies. © The author(s), 2019.",,,Surveillance Studies Network,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,health

The aim of the proposed training method is to increase engagement, attention, and motivation in co-adaptive event-driven MI-BCI training. This was achieved using gamification, progressive increase of the training pace, and virtual reality design reinforcing body ownership transfer (embodiment) into the avatar. From the 20 healthy participants performing 6 runs of 2-class MI-BCI training (left/right hand), 19 were trained for a basic level of MI-BCI operation, with average peak accuracy in the session = 75.84%. This confirms the proposed training method succeeded in improvement of the MI-BCI skills; moreover, participants were leaving the session in high positive affect.

Simulation-based curricula have been developed for a number of procedures, including gastrointestinal endoscopy. Gamification, which is the application of game-design principles to non-game contexts, is an instructional strategy with potential to enhance learning. No studies have investigated the effects of a comprehensive gamification curriculum on the acquisition of endoscopic skills among novice endoscopists. Methods and analysis Thirty-six novice endoscopists will be randomised to one of two endoscopy SBT curricula: (1) the Conventional Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive 6 hours of one-on-one simulation training augmented with expert feedback and interlaced with 4 hours of small group teaching on the theory of colonoscopy or (2) the Gamified Curriculum Group, in which participants will receive the same curriculum with integration of the following game-design elements: A leaderboard summarising participants' performance, game narrative, achievement badges and rewards for top performance. In line with a progressive learning approach, simulation training for participants will progress from low to high complexity simulators, starting with a bench-top model and then moving to the EndoVR virtual reality simulator. Performance will be assessed at three points: Pretraining, immediately post-training and 4-6 weeks after training. Assessments will take place on the simulator at all three time points and transfer of skills will be assessed during two clinical colonoscopies 4-6 weeks post-training. Mixed factorial ANOVAs will be used to determine if there is a performance difference between the two groups during simulated and clinical assessments.

Dry-sensor EEG is a technology that can be made affordable and easy to use. When combined with gamification of experimental tasks, this could provide a new way to gather data on a large scale. Signal quality is a challenge, but the ease of gathering repeated samples can compensate for this. In this paper we present a new system that uses a novel wearable EEG headset, a tablet-based suite of cognitive games, and a cloud-based data analysis system. A large 12-week at-home feasibility study is described, yielding high adherence and user acceptability, even among older users. Data from that trial replicates well-established EEG and behavioural patterns from the cognitive neuroscience literature. Some initial machine learning analyses show that user age and cognitive performance level can be discriminated from single daily sessions, with much higher classification performance when aggregating over multiple days. © 2018 IEEE.",at-home studies; cognitive health; gamification; machine learning; wireless dry EEG,Artificial intelligence; Learning systems; Neuroimaging; Neurology; Wearable technology; at-home studies; Classification performance; Clinical neuroscience; Cognitive neurosciences; Cognitive performance; Data analysis system; Feasibility studies; Gamification; Pattern recognition,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,YES,,tidak dijelaskan,,,,,,,,

However, the data-driven generation of such structures often lacks labeled resources that can be used as training data for supervised machine learning. The creation of such ground-truth data is a time-consuming process that often requires domain expertise to resolve text ambiguities and characterize linguistic phenomena. Furthermore, the creation and refinement of machine learning models is often challenging for linguists as the models are often complex, in-transparent, and difficult to understand. To tackle these challenges, we present a visual analytics technique for interactive data labeling that applies concepts from gamification and explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) to support complex classification tasks. The visual-interactive labeling interface promotes the creation of effective training data. Visual explanations of learned rules unveil the decisions of the machine learning model and support iterative and interactive optimization. The gamification-inspired design guides the user through the labeling process and provides feedback on the model performance. As an instance of the proposed technique, we present QuestionComb, a workspace tailored to the task of question classification (i.e., in information-seeking vs. non-information-seeking questions). Our evaluation studies confirm that gamification concepts are beneficial to engage users through continuous feedback, offering an effective visual analytics technique when combined with active learning and XAI.  © 2021 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

While building, the crowdsourcing platform is simple, and its success depends on the amount of individuals taking part in it. We propose a brand new gamification methodology to draw folks to participate within the crowdsourcing platform. Reinforcement algorithm is employed in this gamification method to motivate the people. This reinforcement algorithm can direct a user to participate in some actions that yield maximum reward in a crowdsourcing platform. This gamification technique motivates user to participate in various activities in the crowdsourcing platform. The proposed algorithm is applied on a social media application that has been implemented for faculties to share their research and tutorial experience. We proved that participation of faculties in crowdsourcing platform improved after applying this gamification method. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Crowdsourcing; Deep learning; Machine learning algorithm; Motivation; Social media,Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Machine learning; Motivation; Reinforcement; Social networking (online); Crowdsourcing platforms; Gamification; Reinforcement algorithms; Social media; Crowdsourcing,Springer Verlag,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Since these algorithms are complex, there is a need for a system which would enable their application both in everyday work and education processes. This paper describes a software system for learning AI algorithms called SAIL (Software System for AI Learning), which can be used both on computers and mobile devices. The paper gives examples of lab exercises and self-study tasks that through graphic representation and detailed procedures help students master this area. Students can enter their examples into the system and obtain correct solutions for those examples. At any point when an example is simulated, a student can proceed to the next step or go back to the previous one, save the current simulation as a file, or print the detailed procedure as a task solution. SAIL helps lecturers go through the syllabus more efficiently and improve class material, while at the same time it helps students get a better grasp of implemented algorithms. SAIL can also benefit software engineers, who can select and simulate an adequate algorithm to solve a specific problem. The results of the SAIL system are verified within the AI introductory course at the School of Electrical Engineering University of Belgrade and they are presented in this paper. © 2018 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",gamification in education; intelligent systems; knowledge representation and reasoning; mobile learning; search algorithms,Computer software; Formal methods; Heuristic algorithms; Heuristic methods; Intelligent systems; Knowledge representation; Learning systems; Students; Teaching; Current simulation; Education process; Gamification; Graphic representation; Introductory course; Knowledge representation and reasoning; Mobile Learning; Search Algorithms; Learning algorithms,John Wiley and Sons Inc.,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

In this work, we present an approach for universal screening of dyslexia using machine learning models with data gathered from a web-based language-independent game. We designed the game content taking into consideration the analysis of mistakes of people with dyslexia in different languages and other parameters related to dyslexia like auditory perception as well as visual perception. We did a user study with 313 children (116 with dyslexia) and train predictive machine learning models with the collected data. Our method yields an accuracy of 0.74 for German and 0.69 for Spanish as well as a F1-score of 0.75 for German and 0.75 for Spanish, using Random Forests and Extra Trees, respectively. To the best of our knowledge this is the first time that risk of dyslexia is screened using a language-independent content web-based game and machine-learning. Universal screening with language-independent content can be used for the screening of pre-readers who do not have any language skills, facilitating a potential early intervention. © 2020 ACM.",auditory; detection; dyslexia; gamification; language-independent; pre-readers; serious games; universal screening; visual; web-based assessment,Decision trees; Machine learning; Websites; Auditory perception; Early intervention; Game contents; General Intelligence; Language independents; Machine learning models; Mistakes of people; Visual perception; Visual languages,"Association for Computing Machinery, Inc",English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Within these stages, users perform various types of actions based on different human needs. In this position paper, we postulate expanding this workflow by introducing gameful design elements. These can increase a user's motivation to take actions, to improve a model's quality, or to exchange insights with others. By combining concepts from visual analytics, human psychology, and gamification, we derive a model for augmenting the visual analytics processes with game mechanics. We argue for automatically learning a parametrization of these game mechanics based on a continuous evaluation of the users' actions and analysis results. To demonstrate our proposed conceptual model, we illustrate how three existing visual analytics techniques could benefit from incorporating tailored game dynamics. Lastly, we discuss open challenges and point out potential implications for future research.  © 2019 IEEE.",Gameful Design; Visual Analytics,Design; Game design; Learning systems; Analytic design; Design concept; Design spaces; Gameful designs; Human needs; Interactive machine learning; Knowledge communication; Position papers; Visual analytics; Work-flows; Visualization,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

In effect, certain rewarding elements can ultimately perform like punishments and even punishing ones may perform the role of rewards. Certain ladders silently perform the role of snakes and vice versa in the context of gaming and gamification models of Snakes and Ladders. The machine learning techniques like Q-Learning are helpful to analyze the ultimate underlying nature of complex data models by collaborating mathematical and statistical techniques.

Machine Learning and Gamification are the key technologies used here. As the population rises, the demand for cost-effective methods to reduce the rate of cognitive decline becomes higher. A mobile application is developed to track and develop the brain development of children. In the mobile application, the child initially undergoes an evaluation phase to determine the current level of the cognitive skills of the child. Milestones particular to that age category are also tracked in this evaluation phase. The results of this evaluation phase are analyzed by the machine learning model and suitable brain games are suggested. K-means algorithm is used to develop the model which is an unsupervised learning algorithm. The dataset is prepared by storing the results of each game category in the evaluation phase. Data preprocessing is done to clean up the dataset. During this period, data undergoes a series of steps. The dataset is divided into 80% and 20%. 80% of the dataset is used as the training dataset and the remaining 20% as the test dataset. The accuracy of the model is checked several times against the test data. Model accuracy is improved through model training and finally, the model got an accuracy of 88.49%. For the child, proper training is given to improve his cognitive skills and thus the brain development using Gamification.

Therefore, teaching them to have a better future is very important. Also, as the adults we have to motivate them to overcome the obstacles and challenges they face throughout their lifetime. When considering about the children, there are various types of children in our society. As examples there are children with special needs and there are children who are mentally and physically stable. Children with special needs require special attention than the other children. These kinds of children with special needs have various types of development disabilities. They are children with low psychological maturity level, autism, down syndrome, genetic disorders etc. We have proposed a system to motivate these children who are with low psychological maturity level named as 'STEP-UP'. This system is a combination of four individual modules that have the common goal to motivate these kinds of children which were implemented using gamification, Image processing, machine learning and Human Computer Interaction. One individual module is focused on disabled children, and it will motivate those children using gamification. Another two modules are focusing on the children who are with low psychological maturity level. And that will motivate those kinds of children using gamification and HCI based technologies like Virtual Reality. The other module is a protocol to secure the data sent between the system and the database. The common goal of this overall STEP-UP system is to motivate the children with low psychological maturity level and disabled children. © 2022 IEEE.",Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD); Augmented Reality; Gamification; Human Computer Interaction; Image Processing; Machine Learning; Virtual Reality,Augmented reality; Diseases; Human computer interaction; Virtual reality; Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder; Disabled children; Down's syndrome; Gamification; Genetic disorders; Images processing; Machine-learning; Maturity levels; Special needs; Machine learning,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

It comprises information on student’s characteristics such as background knowledge, learning style preference, goals, personality etc. The foremost challenge that the students experience in learning system is that they are unable to bring back relevant information based on their needs. One of the methods used to obtain the students’ needs is to create a highly efficient student profile, which would represent the true students’ needs. Our contribution consists in modeling a student’s profile based on many important characteristics. In this context, we developed an “SPOnto” ontology to represent a student profile in an adaptive gamified learning system. This ontology will then help the classification of the different types of learners using the machine learning techniques. The present paper epitomizes the implementation of our contribution in a gamified learning environment “Class Quiz” and the assessment of its effectiveness.

For this purpose, we have offered two learning paths, traditional and novel, to our students. We have identified course variables that quantitatively explain the improvements reported when using the innovative methodologies integrated into the course design, and we have applied techniques from the social network analysis (SNA) and the machine learning/deep learning (ML/DL) domains to conduct success/failure classification methods finding that, generally, very good results are obtained when an ensemble approach is used, that is, when we blend the predictions made by different classifiers. The proposed methodology can be used over reduced datasets and variable time windows for having early estimates that allow pedagogical interventions.

With the rapidly surging of mobile sensing, gamification techniques have contributed on making the crowd-sourcing computing techniques a promising paradigm for large-scale data sensing. In this paper, starting from a study of gamification and crowd-sourcing techniques, we present an alternative way of combining gamification techniques with crowd-sourcing in order to preserve cultural heritage sites. The proposed application is a scavenger hunt like game where the players have to complete a series of tasks in the form of riddles. Each task may include sending the location of the user, answering a question, uploading media files or annotating some image or audio files related to the pace of visit. Except from empirical input which comes from the experts, our approach collects external data, engaging the sightseeing visitors with sensing and computing devices collectively share data, related to site’s or monument’s physical structure condition. The collected data are clustered together by archaeological site location and used in machine learning to extract information about the physical condition of the cultural heritage site. Through the application’s results, the experts will take the appropriate decisions in order to estimate and predict if there is any need of intervention to maintain the archaeological site or monument in good condition. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Crowd-sensing; Cultural heritage; Gamification; Machine learning,,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus,YES,,"penerapan gamifikasi pada pengumpulan data tempat arkeologi, untuk digunakan sebagai data latih model ML dalam mengetahui kondisi fisik tempat arkeologi",,,,,,,,

Therefore, we propose a new idea for the realization of a sustainable society under the trend of “social gamification” by combining strategy game ecology mining for the first time. Specifically, we use big data mining to analyze the attributes of the smurf (subsidiary account), and then extract discriminative features and compute a score for each attribute using machine learning, which could accurately locate all the smurf in the game. By banning the smurf, the game ecology is optimized to improve the player's game experience. Meanwhile, this paper proposes appropriate operation strategies for players at different stages based on multi-level clustering.

One way to facilitate this learning process is to integrate the learning into a game situation, which is by definition fun to engage with and offers immediate rewards. This research shows that by collecting the student's behaviour and actions as they engage with well-known game software, the learning of key machine learning concepts can be enabled. It is also shown that customising of learning can be made possible by the use of gamification. © 2018 IEEE.",gamification; machine learning; machine teaching; personalised learning; universal design for learning,Learning systems; Students; Game software; Gamification; Learning process; Personalised learning; Real world situations; Tools and techniques; Universal Design; Machine learning,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

In this paper, we use ontologies to construct user knowledge models, fuse multi-situational similarity metrics, screen out candidate neighbour sets through preliminary screening, then combine the user's activity to construct time-based weight tensor scores, use tensor decomposition to obtain recommendation evaluation values, and finally use the recommendation evaluation values to make artistic recommendations. The experimental results show that the algorithm can still obtain a good recommendation implementation in the case of extremely sparse data.

They have found the subject extremely dry and the nomenclature very challenging. Insidiously, histology is fading from the minds of stakeholders. Unless this is rectified, it is not inconceivable that the subject will be further diluted in the medical curriculum. What contributing factors could there be? Via a survey and focus group discussions, international faculty (n = 111) were asked what the challenges in teaching histology were. Both qualitative and quantitative data were collected and stratified by the number of teaching years. A collaborative teaching session with a pathologist was also delivered to the YLLSoMM1 students (n = 280), who gave opinions about it. Of the international faculty, 85 (±1)% responded. Among those, 60 (±1)% felt that the pedagogy should be reformed (e.g., by gamification). Interestingly, 30 (±1)% opined that organ system histology should be moved into the clinical years. Notably, 70 (±1)% of teachers preferred to teach face to face (FTF) using either microscopes or virtual microscopy. Among the students, 71 (±1)% reported self-teaching from online resources. Significantly, 88 (±1)% of M1 students agreed that having the pathologist co-teach histology was beneficial. Some teachers, and most students, struggle with histology. There is a generational divide in opinions concerning how histology should be taught. The traditionalists wish to maintain the status quo while the reformists want changes. Learners want to be engaged with hybrid approaches aided by the pathologist. They also welcome more clinical context during histology lessons. © 2022 American Association of Clinical Anatomists and British Association of Clinical Anatomists.",challenges; curriculum; histology; medical education,"Curriculum; Education, Medical, Undergraduate; Faculty; Humans; Learning; Microscopy; Students, Medical; Teaching; Article; controlled study; curriculum; digestive system; emotion; emotionality; face to face support group; gamification; histology; human; learning algorithm; lymph node; machine learning; medical education; medical research; medical student; mouth hygiene; organ systems; pathologist; pedagogics; perception; qualitative analysis; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; scoring system; teacher; training; validity; virtual microscopy; learning; medical student; microscopy; teaching; university",John Wiley and Sons Inc,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Backdoor attacks are a process through which an adversary creates a vulnerability in a machine learning model by ?poisoning?' the training set by selectively mislabelling images containing a backdoor object. The model continues to perform well on standard testing data but misclassifies on the inputs that contain the backdoor chosen by the adversary. In this paper, we present the design and development of the Backdoor Game, the first game in which users can interact with different poisoned classifiers and upload their own images containing backdoor objects in an engaging way. We conduct semi-structured interviews with eight different participants who interacted with a first version of the Backdoor Game and deploy the game to Mechanical Turk users (N=68) to demonstrate how users interacted with the backdoor objects. We present results including novel types of interactions that emerged as a result of game play and design recommendations for the improvement of the system. The combined design, development and deployment of our system can help AI Security researchers to study this emerging concept, from determining the effectiveness of different backdoor objects to help compiling a collection of diverse and unique backdoor objects from the public, increasing the safety of future AI systems.  © 2021 ACM.",activation clustering; AI security; backdoor poisoning; gamification,Artificial intelligence; Turing machines; User interfaces; Well testing; Combined design; Design and Development; Design recommendations; Machine learning models; Mechanical turks; Poisoning attacks; Semi structured interviews; Standard testing; Learning systems,Association for Computing Machinery,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper aims to highlight the development of the online travel agencies (hereinafter OTAs) and the way that technology has contributed to this direction by investigating the case of an OTA company, namely e-Travel SA. The Internet seems to have changed dramatically and in a positive way the tourism industry. Information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as artificial intelligence and machine learning, virtual and augmented reality, Internet of things as well as gamification, offer valuable tools and applications both to businesses and to customers. At the same time, the increased use of mobile devices, digital tools and social media along with the unlimited access to information has made consumers demanding and updated. Consequently, they require more and more useful services based on their needs. Considering the aforementioned, it is easy to understand that marketing strategies of many companies have changed and that these companies are now exploiting the state of the art in digital marketing tools in order to get the best possible result. E-Travel is a real example of the OTAs’ evolution during the last decade, and their success proves that opportunities may be generated by exploiting the technological advancements. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Distribution channels; E-Travel; Internet; Marketing; Online travel agencies; Tourism and ICTs,,Springer Science and Business Media B.V.,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

This raises the question of how new employees, especially young professionals, can acquire this knowledge from older generations in an efficient and sustainable way. This can potentially necessitate the creation of incentives for both sides. For the older generation, the rewards must be of such a high quality that they are willing to pass on their expertise without seeing the younger generation as a threat. For the younger generation, ways must be created to accept the knowledge of the older generation as being of great value. In this paper, the authors discuss two methods that can facilitate this process. Gamification, to make the reward systems visible, and nudging, to trigger the benefits of these reward systems. Furthermore, by developing a working prototype, the authors describe how the actual rewards can be stored on Blockchain-based tokens in order to be represented in a permanent and provable way. This system can be supported by machine learning and the long-term preparation of adaptive learning systems, so that the knowledge of the older generation is ultimately made available to a broad group of people. The theoretical foundations are complemented by an online survey and a focus group with experts from the various fields in order to further corroborate the arguments made. © 2020 Academic Conferences Limited.

In general this ability would be defined by a common factor. Deferent types of intelligence, generally are distinguished according to the information on which they operate. Emotional Intelligence (EI) is a type of intelligence which operates on emotional information. It is mentioned that personality disorder is linked to various aspects of EI. The common method for studying the status of individual’s EI is presented in questionnaires which are usually boring and exhausting for kids to fill them out. MSCEIT is one of this assessment tools which has performance-based measurement approach. To make the assessment process more engaging and entertaining for kids, we are going to gamify the whole process. In the first step, we have been designed and implemented a mini-game, which its main mission is to measure kids’ EI by focusing on gamifying Faces and Facilitation tasks which are presented in MSCEIT.

This rapid increase in parcel volume, but also the high number of returned goods-which account for up to 60% of deliveries-poses new challenges in the light of climate change, air pollution and traffic management (EHI Retail Institute 2015; Kristensen K. et al. 2013). Previous initiatives have aimed at the electrification of delivery cars or at the provision of central collection points, but have not used the biggest lever: human behaviour. What is needed are innovative approaches that broaden the scope of action for customers highlighting a more sustainable shopping experience. Within the Think!First project, a modular framework in terms of “level-up” for web shops was designed, developed and evaluated. With the help of gamification strategies, persuasive design principles and machine learning algorithms, users of our test shop were encouraged to behave in a more targeted and environmentally conscious manner while purchasing online goods. In order to measure the impact of our framework, we conducted a nationwide field test which showed that there are significant quantitative changes in interest and knowledge concerning sustainable shopping choices as well as a reduction of returned parcels in the test shop. Qualitative expert interviews showed that online retailers may implement customer-centric Think!First strategies in their own shops taking into account the increasing competition and ever more demanding efforts to satisfy customers. In retrospect our framework can be seen as crucial first step in improving the e-commerce sector on an ecological, a technological and a behavioural level. © The Authors, 2019.

Current methods aim to predict the perceived affective state (i.e., emotion) of an individual in order to improve their motivation and performance by tailoring an application. However, existing methods may struggle to predict the state of an individual that it has not been trained for. Moreover, the affective state that correlates to good performance may vary based on individuals and task characteristics. Given these limitations, this paper presents a machine learning method that uses task information and an individual's facial expression data to predict his/her performance on a gamified task. The training data used to generate the adaptive-individual-task model is updated every time new data from an individual is acquired. This approach helps to improve the model's prediction accuracy and account for variations in facial expressions across individuals. A case study is presented that demonstrates the feasibility and performance of the model. The results indicate that the model is able to predict the performance of individuals, before completing a task, with an accuracy of 0.768. The findings support the use of adaptive models that dynamically update their training data set and consider task information and individuals' facial expression data. © 2018 IEEE.",Facial expression; gamification; machine learning; performance,Behavioral research; Gamification; Machine learning; Motivation; Facial expression data; Facial Expressions; Machine learning methods; Machine learning models; Motivation and performance; Prediction accuracy; Task characteristics; Training data sets; Forecasting,Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus,,,,,,,,,,,

Already in 2015, an European market volume of 444 billion Euros at an annual growth of 13.3% was achieved, of which clothing and footwear account for 12.7% as the largest category (Willemsen et al., 2016). However, online commerce will only have a better footprint than buying in the local retail shop under optimal conditions (for example: group orders, always present at home delivery, no returns and no same day delivery). Next to frequent single deliveries, CO2 intensive and underutilized transport systems, returned goods are the main problem of online shopping. The last is currently estimated at up to 50% (Hofacker and Langenberg, 2015; Kristensen et al., 2013). Our research project Think!First tackles these problems in freight mobility by using an unique combination of gamification elements, persuasive design principles and machine learning. Customers are animated, targeted and nudged to choose effective and sustainable means of transport when shopping online while ensuring best fit by compensating both manufacturer and customer biases in body size estimation. Here we show preliminary results and also present a slightly modified rule learning algorithm that always characterizes a given class (here: returns).

While this is an attractive concept, with an already-demonstrated capability to positively disrupt industries around the world, it remains a dangerous premise that demands attention and intentional resource allocation to ensure that these systems’ behaviors match our expectations. Until we can develop explainable AI techniques or high-fidelity simulators to enable us to examine the models’ underlying logic for the situations we intend to utilize them in, it will be irresponsible to place our trust in their ability to act on our behalf. In this work we describe and provide guidelines for ongoing efforts in using novel explainable AI techniques and high-fidelity simulation to help establish shared expectations between autonomous systems and the humans who interact with them, discussing collaborative robotics and cybersecurity domains. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Cyber range; Cybersecurity; Explainable AI; Gamification; Human-robot interaction; Interpretable machine learning,Human engineering; Intelligent systems; Security of data; AI techniques; Autonomous systems; Cyber security; High-fidelity simulations; High-fidelity simulators; Human-centered automation; Implicit trusts; Social robots,Springer,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus,YES,,,,,,,,,,

However, sustaining voluntary contributions of map data can be difficult and hybrid machine learning-VGI (ML-VGI) workflows developed to encourage sustained volunteer contributions have been demonstrated to be insufficient. Gamification can be used to encourage volunteers to map for longer, however evaluations of gamification to increase humanitarian mapping contributions are rare. Here we develop a gamified humanitarian ML-VGI mapping platform (“Map Safari”) and evaluate the use of game elements to encourage sustained volunteer contributions without reducing contribution quality. Our results suggest that gamification makes mapping more fun, particularly for first time mappers, without degrading map data quality. Competition is demonstrated to be important for encouraging enjoyment of game elements and increasing map data contributions. Future gamified mapping platforms should emphasize competition and ensure there are enough game elements to make platform use feel game-like. This research demonstrates that gamification can be used to encourage continued voluntary contributions of map data thereby increasing the amount of map data available to humanitarian organizations. © 2023 Cartography and Geographic Information Society.",humanitarian mapping; motivation; user evaluation; Volunteered geographic information; volunteering,Quality control; Data production; Game elements; Gamification; Humanitarian mapping; Map data; User evaluations; Voluntary contributions; Volunteer contributions; Volunteered geographic information; Volunteering; data set; humanitarian aid; information processing; machine learning; mapping; Mapping,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,English,Article,Final,,Scopus,YES,,mengevaluasi data mapping VGI pada proses gamifikasi untuk meningkatkan minat kontribusi sukarelawan,,,,,,,,

The software platform tested during this study utilizes a compelling storyline, machine learning, and friendly competition to promote science, technology, engineering, and math within secondary school systems. This report contains lessons learned from the pilot programs conducted by Intergalactic Education within the Charles County Maryland School District. During this period, three classes of 8th-grade honors algebra students were allowed access to a simulation game called Space World™. One of the teachers involved in the program was chosen by the Space Foundation to become a part of their selective Teacher Liaison Program cohort. This analysis also identified a number of shortcomings in existing education technology solutions. The research indicates that most digital instructional products do not have the high-fidelity graphics and animations that millennials have come to expect from applications they download on their handheld computers. Additionally, teachers and school administrators are not effectively leveraging big data collection that should be integrated into existing curriculum.

We often get stuck in our busy schedules, that we don't have time to oversee our routine health and habits. Our habit-building and productivity web app helps the user to stay mindful and accountable for the goals they have set. An effective alternative to traditional habit tracking tools, developed with gamification features. Gamification is the application of game elements to non-game environments in order to engage the audience and inject enthusiasm into mundane activities while also providing motivational and cognitive benefits. This web application presents the users with real-life scenarios, situations, and challenges that offer interesting game-play, making goal development and tracking much more effective and motivating than traditional quizzes and tests. Some take-away features of this app are: Multiple habit tracker, In-app calendar, Streak counter; Customized dashboard and goal screen; Graphs and report tracking; element. Providing an easy navigation with no pre-requisite skills needed makes it appealing to users. Anxiety disorders and well-being were the most frequently observed mental health and well-being domains, while conduct disorder and bipolar disorders were the least frequently noticed. The rationale for using gamification to improve mental health and well-being was identified in 59 percent (41/70) of the studies, and it was roughly divided into two themes: (1) encouraging engagement and (2) enhancing an intervention's desired effects.
