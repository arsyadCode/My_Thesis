1,Greenhouse gases trade-off from ponds: an overview of emission process and their driving factors,"Inland water bodies (particularly ponds) emit a significant amount of greenhouse gases (GHGs), particularly methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and a comparatively low amount of nitrous oxide (N2O) to the atmosphere. In recent decades, ponds (<10,000 m2) probably account for about 1/3rd of the global lake perimeter and are considered a hotspot of GHG emissions. High nutrients and waterlogged conditions provide an ideal environment for CH4 production and emission. The rate of emissions differs according to climatic regions and is influenced by several biotic and abiotic factors, such as temperature, nutrients (C, N, & P), pH, dissolved oxygen, sediments, water depth, etc. Moreover, micro and macro planktons play a significant role in CO2 and CH4 emissions from ponds systems. Generally, in freshwater bodies, the produced N2O diffuses in the water and is converted into N2 gas through different biological processes. There are several other factors and mechanisms which significantly affect the CH4 and CO2 emission rate from ponds and need a comprehensive evaluation. This study aims to develop a decisive understanding of GHG emissions mechanisms, processes, and methods of measurement from ponds. Key factors affecting the emissions rate will also be discussed. This review will be highly useful for the environmentalists, policymakers, and water resources planners and managers to take suitable mitigation measures in advance so that the climatic impact could be reduced in the future."
2,Well-to-wheel greenhouse gas emissions of electric versus combustion vehicles from 2018 to 2030 in the US,"Electric vehicles (EVs) can reduce transportation-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, given the planned electric grid decarbonization. Regulations can also reduce internal combustion engine vehicle's (ICEVs) emissions by mandating increased fuel economies or ethanol-gasoline mixes. Factors such as fuel economy, electricity grid mix, vehicle choice, and temperature affect EV GHG emissions relative to ICEVs, and successfully decarbonizing the transportation sector depends on understanding their combined effects. We use life-cycle assessment to compare the EV and ICEV well-to-wheel GHG emissions in the United States and four other states from 2018 to 2030. We found lower emissions for EVs than ICEVs in most conditions considered. In New York state, where natural gas power plants replace nuclear energy, GHG emissions of electricity generation increase over time after 2020. Future ICEVs can have comparable emissions to EVs due to fuel economy increase. Therefore, EV and ICEV can together lower transportation GHG emissions at a faster pace."
3,Characteristics of greenhouse gas emissions from farmland soils based on a structural equation model: Regulation mechanism of biochar,"Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from soil carbon and nitrogen cycles during freeze-thaw cycles (FTCs) provide positive feedback to climate warming. Biochar is a new type of soil conditioner that shows potential in soil GHG emissions reduction. To explore the mechanisms of the effects of biochar on soil GHG emissions in seasonally frozen soil areas, this study focused on farmland soil in the Songnen Plain. Variations in soil environmental factors, available carbon and nitrogen and microbial biomass were analyzed using an indoor simulation of soil FTCs. A structural equation model (SEM) was established to reveal the key driving factors and potential mechanism of biochar on soil GHG emissions under FTCs. The results showed that biochar increased carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by 3.40% and methane (CH4) absorption by 2.52% and decreased nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions by 35.90%. SEM showed that soil temperature (ST) was the main environmental factor determining CO2 emissions and that soil moisture (SM) was the main environmental factor determining CH4 and N2O emissions. Soil available carbon and nitrogen and microbial biomass are important for soil GHG emissions as the reaction substrates and main participants in the biochemical transformation of soil carbon and nitrogen, respectively. This study showed that the application of biochar in farmland is a feasible choice to address climate change in the long term via soil carbon sequestration and GHG emissions reduction. The research results provide a theoretical basis and scientific guidance for soil GHG emissions reduction during FTCs in middle to high latitudes."
4,The role of renewable energy and urbanization towards greenhouse gas emission in top Asian countries: Evidence from advance panel estimations,"The increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and environmental degradation (ED) is a serious concern for the various economies, and a similar issue is observed in Asia. This paper investigated the role of clean energy from renewable sources, urbanization, and economic growth in determining the level of GHG emissions from 1995 to 2018 for ten Asian States through a cross-sectional autoregressive distributed lagged (CS-ARDL) model. Meanwhile, the current research also examined the cross-sectional dependence, unit root properties, and co-integration between the study variables. The study findings confirmed that clean energy and GDP2 played their constructive role in reducing GHG emissions in the natural environment or targeted economies. In contrast, urbanization and economic growth caused more GHG emissions both in the long and short run. Furthermore, the robust check through augmented mean group (AMG) and common correlated effect means group (CCEMG) also confirmed that clean energy and GDP2 have a good sign for lowering ED compared to GDP and urbanization. The study findings could support policymakers, specifically in the field of energy economics and environmental sustainability. Therefore, it is highly recommended that some strong policy implications are needed to reduce environmental issues through controlling the negative impact of economic growth and urbanization. This study contributes in the literature of GHG emission with respect to economic growth, urbanization and clean energy and guided the regulators while formulating policies related to control the GHG emission."
5,"How do green energy investment, economic policy uncertainty, and natural resources affect greenhouse gas emissions? A Markov-switching equilibrium approach","Energy efficiency has enormous potential for boosting economic development while simultaneously reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Energy efficiency improvements are widely accepted as a necessary corollary of China's decarbonisation efforts. This study analysed key factors in green energy investment and its determinants, i.e. natural resources and uncertainty of economic policy on greenhouse gas emissions, from 1987 to 2019. This work conduct a thorough empirical analysis and used innovative econometric techniques, such as the Markov-switching equilibrium correction model for long-run estimation and the kernel-based regularised least squares machine-learning approach, to establish the direction of causality for the variables in this study. The results indicate that green energy investment is significantly correlated with greenhouse gas emissions and helps to support environmental quality. However, although natural resources and economic policy uncertainty support economic growth, they are harmful to environmental quality. This conclusion implies that the Chinese government should exploit green energy investment to strengthen environmental performance as its long-term strategy."
6,How urbanization and ecological conditions affect urban diet-linked GHG emissions: New evidence from China,"Unprecedented urbanization is dramatically altering habitual food consumption in urban China, and consequently affecting diet-linked greenhouse gas emissions (DGHGEs). Building on the representative resident survey data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey, this study analyzed urban food consumption profiles and related GHG emissions from a life cycle perspective. Moreover, a CATREG (Categorical Regression) model was conducted to identify influencing factors. Results show that urban residents in China generate an average of 2.92 kg CO2e/capita/day, with 1.06 kg of foods consumed. Meat consumption has a dominant role in urban DGHGEs and is the main driver of variation in the DGHGEs. Urbanization level and most demographic factors with regard to household and individual characteristics have significant impacts on urban DGHGEs. However, the resident's awareness of the Chinese Dietary Guideline dose not significantly contribute to promoting low-GHG urban diets. A novel result of this analysis is that local ecological conditions, including geographical climate and resource endowments, have evident effects on urban food consumption and the related GHG emissions, despite the fact that urban areas heavily rely on food resources imported from other regions. Our findings offer knowledge-based inspiration geared to sustainable urban food consumption for both China and other developing countries."
7,The greenhouse gas footprints of China's food production and consumption (1987–2017),"As China urbanized and its economy grew rapidly, its food production and consumption patterns changed dramatically over the past three decades. With this in mind, we evaluate how the nation's greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions related to food production and consumption altered from 1987 to 2017. We further explore key factors that affect GHG emission changes from agricultural production and household diet perspectives. We find that the GHG emissions from China's food production rose 51 percent, while that from food consumption rose 64 percent. The rise in GHG footprint of China's food production was largely caused by the increasing material- and energy-intensive food production system. Agricultural modernization was a main cause of the rise in GHGs, as China was late to the game in improving agricultural productivity. But a more meat-intensive diet accompanied by a general rise in households' use of processed food also helped to drive these transformations. China's growing appetite for meat not only intensified GHG mitigation pressures domestically, but also abroad, as Chinese households began to demand greater variety that was satisfied via imports. Indeed, GHG emissions embodied in imported meats rose over eleven-fold from 2007 to 2017. Through this study, we highlight the importance of future policy-making focused on a more sustainable food system in China to benefit the world's environment, health, and climate."
8,Factors affecting the emission of pollutants in different types of transportation: A literature review,"Given the importance of the environment around the world and its accelerating destruction brought on by the increase in emissions resulting from the growing use of various forms of transportation, this paper shall aim to eliminate this research gap via a thorough investigation of the literature. These goals include the effect of greenhouse gases emitted by the transportation industry on the environment, the impact of pollutants on transportation mode choice, a study of the obstacles to reducing pollution in transportation, and the presentation of solutions and suggestions. In the research, papers related to this topic in various transportation industries, including road, rail, marine, air, and multimodal transportation, and the variables affecting the control of greenhouse gas emissions in any mode of transportation were collected. Afterward, fundamental analysis was carried out, conclusions drawn, and the presentation of suggestions and solutions in this area addressed. Reducing greenhouse gases in transportation is a challenge that requires examining numerous influential variables and factors. The studies presented in this research are expected to be useful, especially for the energy activists, researchers, and policymakers who would like to conduct long-term studies of pollutants in the transportation industry and the variables influencing the control of greenhouse gas emissions."
9,Organic amendments increase crop yield while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the perspective of carbon fees in a soybean-wheat system,"Organic amendment often affects both crop yield and greenhouse gas (GHG) emission. Yet the impact of organic amendment on yield gains and GHG emissions is still unclear, particularly in long-term soybean-wheat cropping system. Based on a 30-year soybean-wheat cropping system experiment, the impact of organic amendments (i.e. straw and manure) on soil properties, crop yield, N2O and CH4 emissions, and net ecosystem economic budget (NEEB) were investigated. The treatments were: chemical NPK fertilizer (NPK), chemical NPK plus low amount of wheat straw (NPKLS), chemical NPK plus high amount of wheat straw (NPKHS), chemical NPK plus pig manure (NPKPM), chemical NPK plus cattle manure (NPKCM), and a control with no fertilizer applied (CK). The long-term straw and manure amendments enhanced soybean yield by 13.1% and 44.0%, and improved wheat yield by 6.4% and 9.9%, respectively. Meanwhile, they stimulated N2O emissions by 25.1% and 49.0% respectively, without significant effect on CH4 emissions, compared to the chemical NPK fertilizer treatment (NPK). The results of structural equation model showed that soil properties tested explained 76% of the variations observed in N2O emissions, which were directly affected by soil nitrification capacity, pH and denitrification capacity. Although straw and manure amendments increased the total GHG emissions investigated by 25.7% and 48.6% respectively, they showed insignificant effects on the greenhouse gas intensity (GHGI), and increased NEEB by 8.6% and 21.1%, respectively, compared to the NPK treatment. This indicates that the benefits arising from crop yield improvement through the use of organic amendments can cover the carbon fees caused by increased GHG emissions. Our findings suggest that organic amendment can be an effective strategy to simultaneously increase crop yield while mitigating greenhouse gas emissions from the perspective of carbon fees."
10,The Impact of Renewable Energy Sources on the Sustainable Development of the Economy and Greenhouse Gas Emissions,"Growing population and limited energy resources have impacted energy consumption. Limited fossil fuel resources and increased pollution threaten national and human societies. These elements emphasize energy sources. Renewable energy use affects growth. All new energy sources, including renewables, are crucial for global economic growth. Economic and environmental issues have led to new approaches in international environmental law, including the green economy. This study employs structural vector auto-regression (SVAR) to compare the effects and outcomes of increasing the use of renewable energy in the context of economic growth and greenhouse gas emissions in middle income countries (MICs) and high income countries (HICs). The results show that these indicators demonstrate that the production of energy from renewable sources has positive short-term and long-term economic effects with varying contributions. However, renewable energies have a greater impact on the green economy in selected MICs than in selected HICs. Therefore, the promotion of macroeconomic indicators is viewed as one of the reasons for the development of policies to increase energy production from renewable sources in selected countries."
11,"Biochar application for greenhouse gas mitigation, contaminants immobilization and soil fertility enhancement: A state-of-the-art review","Rising global temperature, pollution load, and energy crises are serious problems, recently facing the world. Scientists around the world are ambitious to find eco-friendly and cost-effective routes for resolving these problems. Biochar has emerged as an agent for environmental remediation and has proven to be the effective sorbent to inorganic and organic pollutants in water and soil. Endowed with unique attributes such as porous structure, larger specific surface area (SSA), abundant surface functional groups, better cation exchange capacity (CEC), strong adsorption capacity, high environmental stability, embedded minerals, and micronutrients, biochar is presented as a promising material for environmental management, reduction in greenhouse gases (GHGs) emissions, soil management, and soil fertility enhancement. Therefore, the current review covers the influence of key factors (pyrolysis temperature, retention time, gas flow rate, and reactor design) on the production yield and property of biochar. Furthermore, this review emphasizes the diverse application of biochar such as waste management, construction material, adsorptive removal of petroleum and oil from aqueous media, immobilization of contaminants, carbon sequestration, and their role in climate change mitigation, soil conditioner, along with opportunities and challenges. Finally, this review discusses the evaluation of biochar standardization by different international agencies and their economic perspective."
12,Life-cycle assessment of two sewage sludge-to-energy systems based on different sewage sludge characteristics: Energy balance and greenhouse gas-emission footprint analysis,"Anaerobic digestion and incineration are widely used sewage sludge (SS) treatment and disposal approaches to recovering energy from SS, but it is difficult to select a suitable technical process from the various technologies. In this study, life-cycle assessments were adopted to compare the energy- and greenhouse gas- (GHG) emission footprints of two sludge-to-energy systems. One system uses a combination of AD with incineration (the AI system), whereas the other was simplified by direct incineration (the DI system). Comparison between three SS feedstocks (VS/TS: 57.61 -73.1 ds.%) revealed that the AI system consistently outperformed the DI system. The results of sensitivity analyses showed that the energy and GHG emission performances were mainly affected by VS content of the SS, AD conversion efficiency, and the energy consumption of sludge drying. Furthermore, the energy and GHG emission credit of the two systems increased remarkably with the increase in the VS content of the SS. For the high-organic-content sludge (VS/TS: 55%–80%), the energy and GHG emission credit of the AI system increase with the increase of AD conversion efficiency. However, for the low organic content sludge (VS/TS: 30%–55%), it has the opposite effect. In terms of energy efficiency and GHG performance, the AI system is a good choice for the treatment of high-organic-content sludge (VS/TS>55%), but DI shows superiority over AI when dealing with low organic content sludge (VS/TS<55%)."
13,The influence of political ideology on greenhouse gas emissions,"This research tests the casual link from political ideology to national greenhouse gas emissions by utilizing multinational panel data covering 98 countries during the period 1990–2016. Overall, the baseline results and robustness tests show a political divide on national greenhouse gas emissions, whereby compared to right-wing governments, left-wing governments are more likely to exhibit less carbon dioxide emissions. We further explore this topic from the perspectives of energy efficiency and education. Three-stage OLS regressions suggest that leftist parties increase energy efficiency and spend more on secondary education, which lead to less greenhouse gas emissions. We also introduce the interaction between political ideology and economic performance as well as globalization to test the moderating effects of economic performance and globalization. The study further looks into the interaction effects of political ideology and democracies on greenhouse gas emissions by dividing the whole sample into two sub-samples. The results indicate that the ideology effect on greenhouse gas emissions varies among countries with different economic performances or different degrees of political globalization, as well as between democracies and non-democracies."
14,"Trajectory, driving forces, and mitigation potential of energy-related greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in China's primary aluminum industry","As the world's largest primary aluminum producer, China's primary aluminum industry (PAI) faces a huge challenge in reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. However, detailed research on presenting the historical trajectory of GHG emissions from China's PAI and identifying the main driving factors affecting its changes has not been completed thus far. This study quantifies the GHG emission trajectory of China's PAI from 1990 to 2018 and identifies the key driving factors affecting its changes. The results show that the total GHG emissions from China's PAI from 1990 to 2018 increased by approximately 18 times, reaching 481 Tg CO2-eq in 2018, of which 69 %, 17 %, and 14 % were electricity-related, fuel-related, and process-related, respectively. Additionally, the production activity effect is the main factor driving the increase in GHG emissions; however, the energy intensity and energy emission factor effects can effectively reduce GHG emissions. Based on this, scenario analysis is used to evaluate the GHG emission mitigation potential of China's PAI by 2030. According to our analysis, policy suggestions for mitigating the GHG emissions in China's PAI are proposed, including reducing the energy intensity, promoting clean energy use, controlling the production capacity, and decarbonizing electricity."
15,Analysis of agricultural greenhouse gas emissions using the STIRPAT model: a case study of Bangladesh,"The agriculture sector is one of the leading emitters of greenhouse gases in Bangladesh, owing to increasing mechanization, changing population patterns and increasing cultivation of irrigation intensive crops like rice. The objective of this research is to analyze how population trends, energy use and land use practices impact the emissions of three greenhouse gases from the agriculture sector in Bangladesh. The gases studied are carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide. The Stochastic Impacts by Regression on Population, Affluence, and Technology (STIRPAT) model and ridge regression are used to analyze the drivers of emissions covering the period from 1990 to 2014. Explanatory factors of emissions are the total and rural population, affluence, urbanization, fertilizer intensity and quantity, carbon and energy intensity, irrigation, rice cultivation, cultivated land and crop yield. The findings reveal that the country’s total population has a negative effect, and the rural population has a negative, nonlinear impact on the emissions of methane. Affluence affects emissions of all the gases. The energy intensity and carbon intensity of agriculture increase carbon dioxide emissions. The cultivated land area, rice cultivation quantity and crop yield increase methane emissions, while irrigated land area decreases it. Rural population, total population and urbanization have a positive linear effect on carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide emissions. Fertilizer quantity and intensity increase nitrous oxide emissions. The findings imply that increasing agricultural mechanization should be based on clean energy, and land management should be regulated to enable the country to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) targets as well as the targets of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 of increasing the share of clean energy."
16,Impact of plant-based meat alternatives on cattle inventories and greenhouse gas emissions,"New plant-based meat (PBM) alternatives that aim to mimic the taste and texture of beef could have significant economic, environmental, and animal welfare impacts if they replace traditional animal-based meats and reduce livestock production. Whether PBM alternatives can achieve these ends depends on the extent to which consumers are willing to substitute for PBM alternatives, the structure of the meat industry, and the inter-linkages of the livestock industry with the other parts of the economy. We construct and calibrate an economic model to estimate how a reduction in PBM prices, or increase in demand for PBM, in the United States affects cattle production. For every 10% reduction in price or increase in demand for PBM, we estimate U.S. cattle production falls approximately 0.15%, U.S. cattle producers' economic welfare falls by $300 million year−1, and U.S. consumer welfare rises by $513 million year−1. Key variables affecting model outcomes include the supply elasticity of cattle, the share of the total cost of cattle used to produce ground beef, and cross price-elasticity of demand between PBM and ground beef. Increases in U.S. demand for PBM alter trade patterns, leading to a reduction of beef imports and an increase in beef exports, a phenomenon that further reduces global greenhouse gas emissions and land use given the relative efficiency of U.S. beef production. For every 10% reduction in the price of PBM alternatives, we estimate that the global reduction in emissions is equivalent to 0.34% of U.S. emissions from beef production and 1.14% when including reduced land-use change emissions. Even substantial reductions in prices of PBM alternatives are unlikely to have substantive impacts on the U.S. cattle population and emissions, suggesting the need to also pursue alternative mitigation strategies, such as innovations to reduce the methane emissions per head."
17,Statistical analysis of greenhouse gas emissions of South Korean residential buildings,"This study analyzed the status of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of residential buildings in South Korea from 2015 to 2019, based on energy consumption data for all residential buildings in the country from the Korea National Building Energy Database. The analysis revealed that new residential buildings had a lower GHG emission intensity than old residential buildings and that strengthening the Building Energy Conservation Code (BECC) contributes to the reduction of GHG emissions from heating energy use in residential buildings. The GHG emission intensity for heating energy use of apartments to which the latest standard (0.21 W/m2·K U-value of exterior walls) was applied was 35.8% lower than that of apartments to which the insulation standard was not applied. However, despite the strengthening of the BECC, the GHG emission intensity for baseload and cooling energy use of apartments increased. This means that the BECC does not contribute to reducing GHG emissions from baseload and cooling energy use. Moreover, as the number of residential buildings continues to increase, their consolidated GHG emissions also increase. Since heating energy consumption is significantly influenced by the weather, GHG emissions from heating energy use can vary depending on the weather. For instance, GHG emissions from heating energy use can increase in extremely cold winter despite the strengthening of the BECC. Therefore, a policy is needed for strengthening the BECC as well as for enhancing building occupants' understanding of GHG emissions reduction in buildings and for promoting the occupants’ behavior change."

Using two different empirical approaches (Dynamic Auto-Regressive Distributed Lags and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps), time-series results show that municipal waste and economic growth have both a short- and a long-run impact on GHG emissions. Moreover, causality analyses evidence the presence of a unidirectional causal flow running from municipal waste and economic growth to greenhouse gas emissions, while a bidirectional causality between municipal waste and economic growth. The results of the static analysis of the municipal solid waste cognitive map show that the most significant system variables relate to the domains of “policy drivers” (education and awareness campaigns and extended producer responsibility) and “environment and health” (GHG emissions). Findings of the policy scenario simulations reveal that the most effective drivers are those about the mission-oriented policy approach."
19,Response of eutrophication and water quality drivers on greenhouse gas emissions in lakes of China: A critical analysis,"Lakes, especially shallow lakes, contribute disproportionately to greenhouse gas (GHG; particularly CO2 and CH4) emissions and have received global attention due to their high potential to contribute to global warming and future climate change. Recent studies have identified eutrophication as a critical factor in GHG emissions. However, the role of lake trophic state index (TSI) and the impact of important water quality parameters (WQP) such as pH, Chl-a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus and organic carbon on GHG emissions are still a subject of debate and an area of intense research. To further understand the relationship between GHG and lake eutrophication, datasets (GHG and WQP) from the scientific literature have been compiled, and statistical analyses of these secondary data were performed to determine the influence of eutrophication on GHG emissions. In this review, GHG emissions from Chinese lakes are quantified, and the important factors affecting these emissions are analysed systematically. The statistical analysis reveals that chlorophyll a and carbon (as TOC) are the key factors of lake eutrophication and have a significant effect on the GHG potential (mainly CH4 fluxes). In addition, the proposed mitigation measures could serve as a guide for scientists and young researchers to reduce future climatic risks."
20,Effects and mechanisms of land-types conversion on greenhouse gas emissions in the Yellow River floodplain wetland,"The mechanism and extent of changes in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from seasonal river-floodplain wetlands subjected to land-type conversion are unknown. We monitored GHG fluxes and characterized soil microbial communities in four types of wetland (Riverside lower-beach wetland (RLW), Riverside higher-beach wetland (RHW), Cultivated wetland (CW), Mesophytic wetland (MW)) in the Yellow River flood land. Results revealed that land reclamation activities altered the distribution patterns of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) in soil, as well as the structure and activities of microbial communities, leading to changes in the GHG emissions. Cumulative CO2 and N2O emissions were highest in CW, which were 2.10–10.71 times and 3.19–8.61 times greater than the other three wetlands, respectively, whereas cumulative CH4 emissions were highest in RLW (1850.192 mg·m−2). CW exhibited the highest 100-years-scale Global Warming Potential (GWP100-CO2-eq) (81.175 t CO2-eq·ha−1), which was 9.93, 3.12, and 2.11 times greater than RLW, RHW, and MW. Moreover, reclaiming riverside wetland as farmland will increase CO2 and N2O emission fluxes by 54.546–72.684 t·ha−1 and 2.615–2.988 kg·ha−1, respectively. 16S rRNA high throughput sequencing revealed that bacterial community composition changed significantly overtime and seasons. GHG fluxes showed a significant positive linear correlation with bacterial OTUs (y = 0.71x–319.4, R2 = 0.304) and Shannon index (y = 228.62x–796.6, R2 = 0.336). Structure equation models indicated that soil C, N and moisture content were the primary factors influencing bacterial community evolution, which had an impact on GHG fluxes. Actinomycetes were significantly affected by total carbon (TC) content, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and C/N, while ammonia oxidizing and nitrifying bacteria were greatly influenced by NO3−-N rather than TN and NH4+-N content. Opportunities exist to reduce GHG emissions and mitigate climate change by maintaining the original state of riverside wetland or restoring cultivated land to wetland in the Yellow River floodplain wetland."
