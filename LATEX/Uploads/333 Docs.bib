	abstract = {The covid-19 pandemic has altered the course of the economy all over the world, including Indonesia. Government policy to resort to social restriction and working from home has increased household consumption of energy but reduce the commercial use of energy. Economic growth is greatly affected by the pandemic and had surged to -5.32% during the pandemic but has been increased before the second wave of the pandemic strikes. In the long-term, the economy and electricity consumption are expected to recover. The recent plan to phase out coal from the energy generation sector has provided the pathway for New and Renewable Energy (NRE) in providing more environmentally friendly electricity to support the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Electricity demand-supply analysis is performed using LEAP and the result demonstrated that full utilization of NRE will reduce GHG emission by more than 700 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent in 2050 and renewable energy mix goal may be achieved in 2050. However, development of smart grid and energy storage should also be developed to compensate the intermittency of wind and solar electricity. Factors such as power generation cost, land requirement, externalities, and grid stability should be carefully studied in order to assure that the electricity produced is affordable and do not pose burden in form of government subsidies. © 2022 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {Indonesian Government has strongly announcement to the public which is in line with the Paris Agreement that has been signed and ratified with other 164 countries across the globe to fulfil their commitment to reduce the greenhouse gas effect. In 2060, the estimated total demand market of about 1800 TWh which is consist of about 300 TWh of electric demand in the present status which will be required additional new energy supply of about 1500 TWh. This new additional energy which is about five times larger than the present energy which leads to more energy resources and alternative energy supplies are required. Meanwhile, fossil fuels as main producer will be reduced and NRE will be utilized more, and it is increased gradually to maintain the energy demand as well as reducing the CO2 emission to the net zero target. In the present study, the contribution of each energy resources especially for the contribution of nuclear power plant (NPP) will be evaluated as a part of national energy mix. The evaluation of nuclear energy contribution is needed to estimate the electricity contribution level as well as the contribution to reduce the CO2 emission and it will compare to other energy resources as comparable analysis. Nuclear power plant requires the lowest install capacity of 211 GWe followed by waste power plant, geothermal and the highest installed capacity was solar PV power plant which requires 765 GWe to produce 1500 TWh electricity for a single 100% power plant. It can be seen the reduction GHG from more than 1300 Mton GHG release from coal can be reduce significantly by NRE of about more than 95% of reduction factor. Total electric contributions based on all energy mix, and it shows nuclear energy contributes 247 TWh (16,5 %) in total 1500 TWh. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Carbon storage in tropical peat ecosystems over thousands of years, especially within peat soil, is in huge quantity. Degradation of peat ecosystems is generally caused by human factors, whether intentional or not, damaging the carbon storage function of tropical peatlands, where forest clearing, drainage development, and burning of land converted to agriculture and plantations result in significant greenhouse gas emissions. Tropical peat in the Kubu Raya District of West Kalimantan, which has a relatively large area of peat, has been degraded as a cause of uncontrolled drainage and land fires caused by a lack of management after its forest cover was lost. The main impact is an increase in peat CO2 emissions due to changes in land use, especially lowering groundwater levels. Subsequently, the subsidence process also occurs after land clearing. This study aims to obtain the proportion of carbon biomass loss due to the CO2 emission process from reducing the peat layer due to subsidence. Data collection was executed for two years, where CO2 emission was monitored bi-weekly, and the subsidence was measured bi-monthly. The results demonstrate groundwater levels dictate the peat CO2 emission and subsidence. Lowering GWL 30 to-85 cm increases CO2 by more than three times, approximately. The rate of peat subsidence shows similar trends to the emission. The proportion of peat biomass loss on CO2 emission was between 58.9 to 73.5%, except for GWL ~5 cm, where the proportion was the highest at 82%. The results of this study are beneficial in explaining the part of the subsidence that impacts the sources of CO2 emissions from the small-holder oil palm and GWL management on peatlands. © 2022, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

	abstract = {Residential sector is one of the energy-consuming districts of countries that causes CO2 emission in large extent. In this regard, this sector must be considered in energy policy making related to the reduction of emission of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. In the present work, CO2 emission related to the residential sector of three countries, including Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam in Southeast Asia, are discussed and modeled by employing Group Method of Data Handling (GMDH)andMultilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural networks as powerful intelligent methods. Prior to modeling, data related to the energy consumption of these countries are represented, discussed, and analyzed. Subsequently, to propose a model, electricity, natural gas, coal, and oil products consumptions are applied as inputs, and CO2 emission is considered as the model's output. The obtained R2 values for the generated models based on MLP and GMDH are 0.9987 and 0.9985, respectively. Furthermore, values of the Average Absolute Relative Deviation (AARD) of the regressions using the mentioned techniques are around 4.56% and 5.53%, respectively. These values reveal significant exactness of the models proposed in this article; however, making use of MLP with the optimal architecture would lead to higher accuracy. © 2023 Tech Science Press.

	abstract = {Anthropogenic interventions in natural forests have resulted in deforestation and forest degradation. There is a reduction in the number of trees per unit area, which results in changes in forest biomass stocks. Deforestation and forest degradation are believed to contribute to increasing the atmosphere's greenhouse gases. Satellite remote sensing has played an essential role in generating information about deforestation and forest degradation. This study aims to analyze forest degradation and biomass stock changes over forest area in Indonesia's new capital city and surrounding area from 2010 to 2018. Spatial datasets from the Tropical Moist Forests project were used in the analysis and processed using Google Earth Engine. Changes in biomass were analyzed based on a biomass map that was produced using radar data. The results of this study clearly show that in the 2010-2018 period, there have been dynamics of forest cover changes in the new capital city of Indonesia and its surroundings, namely the occurrence of direct deforestation, deforestation after degradation, forest degradation, regrowth, and undisturbed forests. The rate of forest degradation was 34,216 ha yr-1 from 2010 to 2018. The highest rate of forest degradation occurred in 2015, along with the massive incidence of fires. The average aboveground biomass stock in the primary forest is 268 Mg ha-1, while 238 Mg ha-1 in the secondary forest. The loss of some trees resulted in a decrease forest biomass in 2018 by 6.7% of the forest biomass stock in 2010. Forest degradation events are caused mainly by logging and fires that generally occur in extreme drought conditions. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Currently, Indonesia has adopted Low Carbon Development (LCD) in its Medium-Term Development Plan (RPJMN) 2020-2024. One of the priority activities is agriculture, which accounts for 12.21% of total greenhouse gas emissions. The agricultural sector is the victim affected by CO2 emissions, such as degradation, shrinkage of agricultural resources, land and water, shifting planting seasons, crop failures, decreased food production due to rising air temperatures, floods, and droughts. Greenhouse gas emissions are predicted to continue to increase along with the increasing demand for food. The purpose of this study is to predict and find an alternative policy framework for low-carbon development in the agricultural sector in Indonesia. This study uses a quantitative and qualitative approach by Artificial Neural Network (ANN), and multicriteria policy (MULTIPOL) analysis. The data were obtained through secondary data in 2014-2018, and the primary data are in-depth interviews, Focus Group Discussions (FGD), and field observations. The results of ANN show that the predictions of provinces that need to adopt low-carbon development in Indonesia are dominated in production centers such as Java Island, so an alternative policy framework using MULTIPOL is needed. Furthermore, this research establishes three scenarios, eight policies, twenty-six actions, and nine evaluative criteria in analyzing the LCD of the agricultural sector. The results indicate that LCD can be conducted by integrating the speed scenario (S2) with a value ranging from 6.3 (policy to increase capacity and quality of human resources) to 18.7 (circular economy). This scenario accommodates policies related to low carbon reduction and agricultural production increase, such as a circular economy, co-benefit adaptation strategies, low carbon technology innovation, and strengthening low carbon networks. © 2022 WITPress.

	abstract = {Mangroves are important sinks of organic carbon (C) and there is significant interest in their use for greenhouse gas emissions mitigation. Adverse impacts on organic carbon storage potential from future climate change and deforestation would devalue such ambitions, thus global projections of future change remains a priority research area. We modeled the effects of climate change on future C stocks and soil sequestration rates (CSR) under two climate scenarios (“business as usual”: SSP245 and high-emissions: SSP585). Model results were contrasted with CO2 equivalents (CO2e) emissions from past, present and future rates of deforestation on a country specific scale. For C stocks, we found climate change will increase global stocks by ∼7% under both climate scenarios and that this gain will exceed losses from deforestation by the end of the twenty-first century, largely due to shifts in rainfall. Major mangrove-holding countries Indonesia, Malaysia, Cuba, and Nigeria will increase national C stocks by > 10%. Under the high-end scenario, while a net global increase is still expected, elevated temperatures and wider temperature ranges are likely increase the risk of countries’ C stocks diminishing. For CSR, there will likely be a global reduction under both climate change scenarios: 12 of the top 20 mangrove-rich countries will see a drop in CSR. Modeling of published country level mangrove deforestation rates showed emissions have decreased from 141.4 to 6.4% of annual CSR since the 1980’s. Projecting current mangrove deforestation rates into the future resulted in a total of 678.50 ± 151.32 Tg CO2e emitted from 2012 to 2095. Reducing mangrove deforestation rates further would elevate the carbon benefit from climate change by 55–61%, to make the proposition of offsetting emissions through mangrove protection and restoration more attractive. These results demonstrate the positive benefits of mangrove conservation on national carbon budgets, and we identify the nations where incorporating mangrove conservation into their Nationally Defined Contributions offers a particularly rewarding route toward meeting their Glasgow Agreement commitments.

	abstract = {The excessive use of greenhouse gases (mainly carbon dioxide) causes a global emission of greenhouse gases. This has eventually brought climate change and global warming, that will affect the human life standard. Also it has several economical impacts such as increasing the mitigation budget for anticipating the climate change problems by applying a carbon tax as one of strategies to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon tax is one of additional economic instrument and has high possibility to be implemented in Indonesia to help its future low carbon development especially on energy sector. Under such a circumstance, this paper aims to predict the possible impact of implementing a carbon tax implementation on Coal Power Plant (CPP) and revenue recycling for 6 regions in Indonesia i.e. Sumatera, Jawa, Bali and Nusa Tenggara, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, Maluku and Papua. The IRIO (InterRegional InputOutput) model of six regions in Indonesia has been developed based on the Central Bureau of Statistics with seventeen sectors in 2016 to evaluate the impact of carbon taxes with a carbon price of 2,1 USD/ton on CPP and to show the scenarios for the distribution impact of carbon tax revenues on output, wages, and GRDP. The results show the implementation of a carbon price of e 2.1USD/ton will give extra revenue of around 241 Billion Rupiah nationally with the distribution of 73%, 15%, 7%, 3%, 2%, and 1% from Java, Sumatera, Kalimantan, Bali-Nusa Tenggara, and Maluku-Papua, respectively. Through revenue recycling, those values could increase the total output, wages, and GDRP per region by around 451, 100, and 169 Billion Rupiah, respectively. The revenue recyling option and its economic impact for each 17 sectors are also identified in the study with spesific characteristics for each region. In conclusion, the result could help the government determine its climate change mitigation strategy, so it could boost the regional economy. Based on the study results, this paper recommends the government to conduct an intensive monitoring and evaluation on low carbon policies for CPP in Java and Sulawesi. © 2023, Econjournals.

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the greenhouse gases that cause global warming, with the highest atmospheric concentration. Mangrove forests absorb CO2 three times higher than terrestrial forests and tropical rainforests. Moreover, mangrove forests can be a source of Indonesian income in the form of a blue economy. Therefore, an accurate method is needed to investigate mangrove carbon stock. The utilisation of remote sensing data with the results of the above-ground carbon (AGC) detection model of mangrove forests based on multispectral imaging and vegetation index can be a solution to obtain fast, cheap, and accurate information related to AGC estimation. This study aimed to investigate the best model for estimating the AGC of mangroves using Sentinel-2 imagery in Benoa Bay, Bali Province. The Random Forest (RF) method was used to classify the difference between mangrove and non-mangrove by treating several parameters. Furthermore, a semi-empirical approach was used to assess and map the AGC of mangroves. Allometric equations were used to calculate and produce AGC per species. Moreover, the model was built with linear regression equations for one variable x and multiple regression equations for more than one x variable. Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was used to assess the validation of the model results. The results of the mangrove forests area detected in the research location around 1,134.92 ha, with an Overall Accuracy (OA) of 0.984 and a kappa coefficient of 0.961. This study highlights that the best model was the combination of IRECI and TRVI vegetation indices (RMSE: 11.09 Mg/ha) for a model based on red edge bands. Meanwhile, the best results from the model that does not use the red edge band were the combination of TRVI and DVI vegetation indices (RMSE: 13.63 Mg/ha). The use of red edge and NIR bands is highly recommended in building the AGC model of mangrove forests because they can increase the accuracy value. Thus, the results of this study are highly recommended in estimating the AGC of mangrove forests because it has been proven to increase the accuracy value of previous studies using optical images. © 2023 by Forest and Society.},

	abstract = {The Jeneponto Steam Power Plant is the largest 2 unit coal-fired power plant in South Sulawesi with a total capacity of 520MW. Unfortunately, this plant emits a large number of greenhouse gases (GHG), especially CO2, which are detrimental to human health. Therefore, this research aims to determine CO2 emissions from 2013-2019 and estimate possible ways to reduce them from 2020-2029 using the mass balance method to link emissions to its sources' activity measurement. The data shows that a total of 12.39 million tonnes of CO2 were emitted from 2013 to 2019. This data was obtained using the Chronological Production Modeling System (PROSYM) software to calculate, analyze and compare the emissions from various types of coal calories used in the Jeneponto Coal-Fired Power Plant. Furthermore, it is estimated that CO2 emission from 2020 to 2029 is likely to reach 31.551 million tonnes. In addition, the coal was replaced from sub-bituminous to bituminous because, according to the technical specifications of the plant, there was a significant reduction in emissions compared to current coal, bituminous with emissions of 30.658 million tons (EF=1.02), anthracite of 32.069 million tons (EF=1.06), and lignite of 32.943 million tons (EF=1.09). However, this is still smaller than the average emission factor standard for coal power plants in Indonesia according to the UNDP study. © 2022 by authors, all rights reserved.},

Through use of new emissions estimates and a multiregional input-output model, we evaluated land-use emissions embodied in global trade from 2004 to 2017. Annually, 27% of land-use emissions and 22% of agricultural land are related to agricultural products ultimately consumed in a different region from where they were produced. Roughly three-quarters of embodied emissions are from land-use change, with the largest transfers from lower-income countries such as Brazil, Indonesia, and Argentina to more industrialized regions such as Europe, the United States, and China. Mitigation of global land-use emissions and sustainable development may thus depend on improving the transparency of supply chains. © 2022 American Association for the Advancement of Science.

The general purpose of this activity is to strengthen the program in increasing understanding about climate change and its various impacts and encourage implementation of real actions in the community. To support this goal, an inventory of greenhouse gas emissions was carried out at the village level, one of which was Poncosari Village located in Bantul Regency, Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The GHG emissions inventory is carried out for the domestic, transportation, and livestock sectors. The inventory is carried out by surveying each hamlet in the village. The results of the analysis show high emissions from the livestock sector. The contribution of the domestic sector occupies the second position due to the use of firewood. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is one of the world's economies contributing the most to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from the global food system. This study aimed to quantify the environmental impacts of Indonesian vegetable production and the relative contribution of different farm inputs. Data were collected from 322 vegetable farms in the Lembang sub-district in West Java. A Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to estimate global warming potential (GWP), acidification potential (AP), freshwater eutrophication potential (EP), and abiotic resource depletion. Results of the LCA showed that GHG emissions were 14.1 t CO2eq ha−1 yr−1 (0.5 t CO2eq t−1), AP was 39.3 kg SO2eq ha−1 yr−1 (1.4 kg SO2eq t−1), EP was 45.3 kg PO4eq ha−1 yr−1 (1.7 kg PO4eq,), and depletion of phosphate, potash, and fossil fuel resources were 60.0 kg P2O5, 101 kg K2O, and 6299 MJ ha−1 yr−1, respectively (1.9 kg P2O5, 3.7 kg K2O, and 281 MJ t−1). Organic fertilizer use contributed the most to impact categories of global warming, freshwater eutrophication, and acidification, followed by synthetic fertilizer. The sensitivity analysis showed that yield and organic fertilizer use explained most of the variation in GHG emission per ton product. Therefore, it is recommended to include organic fertilizer use in the fertilizer advisory system for vegetable production in Indonesia. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: Energy security has been talked about by governments and policymakers because the global energy market is unstable and greenhouse gas emissions threaten the long-term health of the global environment. One of the most potent ways to cut CO2 emissions is through the production and consumption of renewable energy. Thus, the purpose of this paper is to highlight the drivers that, if ambitious environmental policies are implemented, might improve energy security or prevent its deterioration. Design/methodology/approach: The study uses a balanced panel data set for Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam that covers a period of 30 years (1990–2020). The pooled panel dynamic least squares is used in this study. Findings: The findings show that renewable energy consumption is positively related to gross domestic product per capita, energy intensity per capita and renewable energy installed capacity. Wherein renewable energy use is inversely related to per capita electricity consumption, CO2 emissions and the use of fossil fuel electricity. Originality/value: There is a lack of research identifying the factors influencing energy security in the ASEAN region. Therefore, this study focuses on the drivers that influence energy security, which are explained by the proportion of renewable energy in final energy consumption. Without identifying the demand and supply sources of energy, especially electricity production based on renewable energy techniques, it is hard for policymakers to achieve the desired renewable energy-based outcome. © 2023, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

However, these countries have not been able to protect the quality of their environments simultaneously. As a result, the rising environmental indices in these nations cast a gloomy shadow over their capacity to continue their economic development. It has been shown that a more educated workforce may boost an economy’s absorption capacity and enhance the efficiency of green technology, both of which contribute to lower emissions of greenhouse gases. This article reports on research that examines the link between educating the labor force and environmental sustainability in the MINT economies. In order to conduct an empirical analysis of the data spanning the years 1995–2020, panel ARDL-PMG and NARDL-PMG techniques were used. First, the results of the ARDL-PMG demonstrate that a more highly educated workforce plays a vital role in mitigating CO2 emissions. Moreover, the NARDL-PMG’s results demonstrate that a positive component of a highly educated workforce is a large negative influence on CO2 emissions, whereas in the long run, the negative component of a highly educated workforce has a positive impact on CO2 emissions over time. This article recommends that the MINT nations’ authorities boost education and training for their workforces in order to keep CO2 emissions down. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The analysis of climate change impact is essential to include in conservation planning of crop wild relatives (CWR) to provide the guideline for adequate long-term protection under unpredictable future environmental conditions. These resources play an important role in sustaining the future of food security, but the evidence shows that they are threatened by climate change. The current analyses show that five taxa were predicted to have contraction of more than 30 % of their current ranges: Artocarpus sepicanus (based on RCP 4.5 in both no dispersal and unlimited dispersal scenario and RCP 8.5 in no dispersal scenario by 2050), Ficus oleifolia (RCP 4.5 5 in both no dispersal and unlimited dispersal scenario by 2080), Cocos nucifera and Dioscorea alata (RCP 8.5 in both no dispersal and unlimited dispersal scenario by 2050), and Ficus chartacea (RCP 8.5 in both no dispersal and unlimited dispersal scenario by 2050 and 2080). It shows that the climate change impact is species-specific. Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP) of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and dispersal scenarios influence the prediction models, and the actual future distribution range of species falls in between those scenarios. Climate refugia, holdout populations, and non-analogue community assemblages were identified based on the Protected Areas (PAs) network. PAs capacity is considered an important element in implementing a conservation strategy for the priority CWR. In areas where PAs are isolated and have less possibility to build corridors to connect each other, such as in Java, unlimited dispersal scenarios are unlikely to be achieved and assisted dispersal is suggested. The holdout populations should be the priority target for the ex situ collection. Therefore, by considering the climate refugia, PAs capacity and holdout populations, the goal of keeping high genetic variations for the long-term conservation of CWR in Indonesia can be achieved. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the main contributor to greenhouse gases that affect global warming. The industrial sector is the third largest producer of CO2 and the cement industry is one of the industries that consistently produces the most significant CO2 emissions. The cement industry produces 5-8% of global CO2 emissions. Several methods for reducing specific CO2 emissions have been reported in the cement industry, including calcium looping, which uses the reversible reaction between calcination [calcium carbonate (CaCO3) decomposition] and carbonation [CO2 capture by calcium oxide (CaO)]. This work investigates calcium looping employing limestone obtained directly from several cement factories in Indonesia to observe the carbon-absorption characteristics of limestone from different mining locations. The experiment was carried out using a tube furnace equipped with a controlled atmospheric condition that functions as a calciner and a carbonator. X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy with energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy characterization were conducted to analyse the changes in the experimental samples. The results demonstrated that the reactor configuration was capable of performing the calcination process, which converted CaCO3 to calcium hydroxide [Ca(OH)2], as well as the carbonation process, which captured carbon and converted it back to CaCO3. Parametric analysis was performed on both reactions, including pressure, temperature, duration, particle size and reaction atmosphere. The results show that the limestone obtained from all sites can be used as the sorbents for the calcium-looping process with an average reactivity of 59.01%. Limestone from cement plants in various parts of Indonesia has the potential to be used as carbon sorbents in calcium-looping technology. With a similar CO2 concentration as the flue gas of 16.67%, the experimental results show that Bayah limestone has the maximum reactivity, as shown by the highest carbon-content addition of 12.15 wt% and has the highest CO2-capture capability up to >75% per mole of Ca(OH)2 as a sorbent. Similar levels of the ability to capture CO2 per mole of Ca(OH)2 can be found in other limestones, ranging from 14.85% to 34.07%. The results show a promising performance of raw limestones from different mining sites, allowing further study and observation of the possibility of CO2 emission reduction in the sustainable cement-production process. © 2022 The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Mangrove forests are important carbon sinks, and this is especially true for Indonesia where about 24% of the world's mangroves exist. Unfortunately, vast expanses of these mangroves have been deforested, degraded or converted to other uses resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study was to quantify the climate change mitigation potential of mangrove conservation and restoration in Indonesia. We calculated the emission factors from the dominant land uses in mangroves, determined mangrove deforestation rates and quantified the total emissions and the potential emission reductions that could be achieved from mangrove conservation and restoration. Based on our analysis of the carbon stocks and emissions from land use in mangroves we found: (1) Indonesia's mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks are among the highest of any tropical forest type; (2) mangrove deforestation results in greenhouse gas emissions that far exceed that of upland tropical deforestation; (3) in the last decade the rates of deforestation in Indonesian mangroves have remained high; and (4) conservation and restoration of mangroves promise to sequester significant quantities of carbon. While mangroves comprise only ≈2.6% of Indonesia's total forest area, their degradation and deforestation accounted for ≈10% of total greenhouse gas emissions arising from the forestry sector. The large source of greenhouse gas emissions from a relatively small proportion of the forest area underscores the value for inclusion of mangroves as a natural climate solution. Mangrove conservation is far more effective than mangrove restoration in carbon emissions reductions and an efficient pathway to achieve Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets. The potential emission reduction from halting deforestation of primary and secondary mangroves coupled with restoration activities could result in an emission reduction equivalent to 8% of Indonesia's 2030 NDC emission reduction targets from the forestry sector. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {There are limited data for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from smallholder agricultural systems in tropical peatlands, with data for non-CO2 emissions from human-influenced tropical peatlands particularly scarce. The aim of this study was to quantify soil CH4 and N2O fluxes from smallholder agricultural systems on tropical peatlands in Southeast Asia and assess their environmental controls. The study was carried out in four regions in Malaysia and Indonesia. CH4 and N2O fluxes and environmental parameters were measured in cropland, oil palm plantation, tree plantation and forest. Annual CH4 emissions (in kg CH4 ha−1 year−1) were: 70.7 ± 29.5, 2.1 ± 1.2, 2.1 ± 0.6 and 6.2 ± 1.9 at the forest, tree plantation, oil palm and cropland land-use classes, respectively. Annual N2O emissions (in kg N2O ha−1 year−1) were: 6.5 ± 2.8, 3.2 ± 1.2, 21.9 ± 11.4 and 33.6 ± 7.3 in the same order as above, respectively. Annual CH4 emissions were strongly determined by water table depth (WTD) and increased exponentially when annual WTD was above −25 cm. In contrast, annual N2O emissions were strongly correlated with mean total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) in soil water, following a sigmoidal relationship, up to an apparent threshold of 10 mg N L−1 beyond which TDN seemingly ceased to be limiting for N2O production. The new emissions data for CH4 and N2O presented here should help to develop more robust country level ‘emission factors’ for the quantification of national GHG inventory reporting. The impact of TDN on N2O emissions suggests that soil nutrient status strongly impacts emissions, and therefore, policies which reduce N-fertilisation inputs might contribute to emissions mitigation from agricultural peat landscapes. However, the most important policy intervention for reducing emissions is one that reduces the conversion of peat swamp forest to agriculture on peatlands in the first place. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Contribution in the building sector to the global warming can be tackled by diminishing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (mainly CO2) not only from operational energy but also from the embodied energy (EE) of construction materials. Harvested Wood Products (HWP) such as Cross Laminated Timber (CLT), Glued Laminated (Glulam) timber, among others, make multistorey wooden buildings possible. These wooden buildings could help to reduce EE and CO2emissions significantly. A material flow analysis (MFA) using an I-O (Input-Output) table was used to compare three scenarios for an 8-story apartment building in Indonesia (total floor area: 9140 m2): First, the building had a reinforced concrete structure. Second, the building had a "hybrid"structure with reinforced concrete cores and first-floor elements, consisting of CLT floor panels, and Glulam columns and beams. Third, the building used only CLT panels besides reinforced concrete cores. The results showed that the last scenario achieved the largest CO2emissions and embodied energy reductions (58 t-CO2and 905 GJ), compared with the first scenario (81 t-CO2and 1110 GJ). Furthermore, we compare two methods to apply displacement factors (DF) to assess the CO2emissions savings for each CO2 ton in wood products substituted in place of non-wooden products between the three building scenarios.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2023.},

	abstract = {Many years passed since the adoption of the Paris Agreement, which invites countries to determine their own contributions to climate change mitigation efforts. The Agreement does not offer a standard to measure progress but relies on a process of periodic stocktakes to inform ambition-raising cycles. To contribute to this process, we compare 2021 greenhouse gas emission projections up to 2030 against equivalent projections prepared back in 2015. Both sets of projections were prepared using the same bottom-up modelling approach that accounts for adopted policies at the time. We find that 2021 projections for the G20 as a group are almost 15% lower (approximately 6 GtCO2eq) in 2030 than projected in 2015. Annual emissions grow 1% slower in the coming decade than projected in 2015. This slower growth mostly stems from the adoption of new policies and updated expectations on technology uptake and economic growth. However, around one-quarter of these changes are explained by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on short-term emissions and economic forecasts. These factors combined result in substantially lower emission projections for India, the European Union plus the UK (EU27 + UK), the Unites States, Russia, Saudi Arabia, and South Africa. We observe a remarkable change in South African projections that changed from a substantial increase to now a decline, driven in part by the planned phase-out of most of its coal-based power. Emissions in India are projected to grow slower than in 2015 and in Indonesia faster, but emissions per capita in both countries remain below 5 tCO2eq in 2030, while those in the EU27 + UK decline faster than expected in 2015 and probably cross the 5 tCO2eq threshold before 2030. Projected emissions per capita in Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, and the United States are now lower than projected in 2015 but remain above 15 tCO2eq in 2030. Although emission projections for the G20 improved since 2015, collectively they still slightly increase until 2030 and remain insufficient to meet the Paris Agreement temperature goals. The G20 must urgently and drastically improve adopted policies and actions to limit the end-of-century warming to 1.5 °C. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Land use change (LUC) induced by biofuel production could lead to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, which potentially increase biofuel's carbon intensity. Among the sources of LUC-related emissions for soy biodiesel, the contribution from peatland loss to agricultural plantations in Southeast Asia remains uncertain. Here, we analyzed LUC in Malaysia and Indonesia and modeled its impacts on the GHG emissions of soy biodiesel produced in the United States. It shows that oil palm plantations have more than doubled over 2001-2016 and the area of palm-on-peatlands (PoP) has expanded 3.7 times. Over new palm plantations, the share of PoP is about 19% regardless of time and location and the emission factor (EF) for peatland-to-palm conversion is estimated to be 41.5 Mg CO2 ha-1 yr-1. With these updates on PoP and EF, the contribution of peatland loss (0.7-5.1 g CO2e MJ-1) to biodiesel emissions is only 40-65% of previous estimates, which reduces discrepancies among model simulations used by different agencies. Based on emerging evidence on LUC and related carbon changes, our analysis reexamines regional peatland loss and its impacts on LUC emissions modeling and provides new insights into the estimation of LUC impacts on biofuels' carbon intensity.  © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {The vulnerability of the forest stand area in Borobudur District to tourism activities and land cover change causes high greenhouse gas emissions. Forest stand has the potential for higher carbon storage compared to other land covers. The existence of this forest stand area plays a vital role in mitigating the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Biomass as an instrument for assessing the level of greenhouse gas emissions can be measured using several approaches, including remote sensing and spatial models. This study aimed to determine the spatial distribution of above-ground biomass with a vegetation index approach and allometric method in Borobudur District. The result shows that ARVI and GEMI have lower standard errors because this study only considers one biophysical aspect, diameter at breast height (DBH). The assumption is that both indices can suppress the influence of the atmosphere well. Other vegetation indices such as NDVI and EVI are more sensitive to vegetation abundance so the biophysical aspects considered are not only DBH but also canopy density. Meanwhile, SAVI also has a SE value that is not too high compared to other indices. This is because some samples show subsurface cover in the form of bare soil or litter so that SAVI can suppress the influence of the background well. EVI, which can suppress the influence of soil and atmospheric background, has a fairly good ability. Its shows that the index's sensitivity to vegetation abundance for biomass mapping cannot depend on one variable alone. This is also caused by vegetation cover factors on the ground surface, such as shrubs and herbs, contributing to the spectral response. The estimation results show that the total biomass of forest in the Borobudur District ranges from 0.002 tons/Ha to 11.89 tons/Ha and is primarily distributed in hilly areas. © 43rd Asian Conference on Remote Sensing, ACRS 2022.},

Based on Indonesia Energy Outlook 2019, installed capacity for power generation in Indonesia is still dominated by fossil energy, especially coal, which is almost 50% on mix energy, followed by gas 29%, Oil 7% and renewable energy 14%. Coal will have a major role in the installed power generation in Indonesia until 2025 [1]. The utilization of clean coal technology seems a strategic policy in Indonesia for emission reduction in the power sector. The calculation method based on coal ton conversion into CO2 ton emission on methodological tool of UNFCC "Tool to calculate project leakage CO2 emission from fossil fuel combustion"will be used. The data is also given based on IPCC standard for NCV for fuel type and CO2 emission factor for fuel type. This paper will review utilization of clean coal technology using the advanced technologies include super-critical and ultra-super-critical for coal fired steam power plant in Indonesia furthermore the potential reduction of greenhouse gas emission. The result is potential of CO2 gas reduction in Indonesia approximately 6,140,394.90 ton CO2 and it's equal of 6.14 MTCO2 per year. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Transportation is one of the main sectors contributing to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that cause global climate change. One of the decarbonization strategies from the transportation sector that can be implemented is by switching to a sustainable mode of transportation, especially battery electric vehicles (BEV). Since mid-2021, Obi Island has been producing Mixed Hydroxide Precipitate (MHP). It is an intermediate product of limonite nickel ore processed using hydrometallurgical processing techniques through the first refining plant in Indonesia using High Pressure Acid Leaching (HPAL) technology. The MHP will be processed into Nickel Sulfate (NiSO4.6H2O) and Cobalt Sulfate (CoSO4.7H2O), the primary precursor materials for electric vehicles. The potential GHG emissions reduction in the transportation sector from the processing of limonite nickel ore in Obi Island is 2.04 MtCO2 in 2022 to 21.02 MtCO2 in 2040 with a total accumulation until 2040 of 344.56 MtCO2. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Rapid increasing population of Indonesia poses a future threat to the food supply for the national demand. Furthermore, global climate change is putting a strain on the food supply chain. Droughts, floods, landslides, and pest/disease attacks all have serious consequences for agricultural production, particularly food crops. According to The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) data published in 2017, Indonesia ranks second in the world in terms of food loss and waste contribution, chasing only Saudi Arabia. Moreover, according to the Food Sustainability Index in the Economist Intelligence Unit (2017), Indonesian food loss and waste or uneaten totalled 1.3 million tons in a single year. In Indonesia, the most common method of dealing with food waste is dumping or landfilling, which produces methane and other greenhouse gases that contribute to climate change. This research was conducted by employing quick survey for colecting primary data and desk evaluation study for collecting secondary data. Meta analysis was employed in this research. Therefore, to emphasize the importance of reducing food loss and waste in Indonesia to reduce food insecurity caused by climate change, this paper investigates how food loss and waste exacerbates climate change. This paper outlined some scenarios for preventing food loss and waste at all stages of the food chain, including agricultural production, post-harvest handling and storage, distribution and consumption behaviour, and government policy, which can be implemented to begin initiatives to reduce food loss and waste to address the threat of future starvation in Indonesia because of climate change. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing.

The development regarding to sustainable development goal (SGD) has drawn attention towards sustainability related concern. So, this paper aims to find out that natural resources have significant aspects to contribute for the environmental quality and greenhouse gas emission. The purpose of study is to asses impacts of economic growth, natural resources, renewable and non-renewable energy usage on carbon emissions for timespan of 1995 to 2019 in ten nations (China, India, Pakistan, Japan, Indonesia, Turkey, South Korea, Thailand, Iran and Saudi Arabia), chosen for their high gross domestic product (GDP) in the Asian region, using the panel data estimating technique CS-ARDL. The long-run elasticities of all nations were estimated. Findings indicate that use of non-renewable and renewable energy contributes to economic development in these countries. Additionally, natural resources limit economic progress in nations panels, but they stimulate economic activity in these countries. Non-renewable energy sources and economic expansion both raise carbon emissions, whilst renewable energy usage reduces carbon emissions. In the case of each nation panel, natural resources also contributed to carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Policy recommendations can be made, such as using renewable energy sources to reduce CO2 emissions and improving educational system along with manipulating government system to boost economic growth in examined areas. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In the past two decades, ASEAN countries have witnessed a rapid rise in air pollution, and environmental degradation has become a severe problem in this region. This is because manufacturing, machinery, chemicals, and allied industries are the main economic sectors on which developing nations in the ASEAN-5 area have concentrated their efforts. However, these are significant sources of greenhouse gas emissions. In response, each of the ASEAN-5 nations has pledged to reduce its carbon emissions. Additionally, one of the crucial challenges that these nations face is the choice and modification of product structure. This study was conducted to analyze the impact of economic diversification, income per capita, foreign direct investment, and electricity consumption on carbon emissions in developing ASEAN-5 nations (Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the Philippines) from 1986 to 2019. By adopting the pooled mean group approach, the empirical results showed that economic diversification reduces CO2 emissions while its square has the opposite effect. Electricity consumption positively influences carbon emissions in the long run, while economic growth drives environmental degradation both in the short and long run. Based on the findings, it can be recommended that ASEAN-5 governments increase economic diversification and reduce non-renewable energy consumption to promote sustainable development and environmental protection. © 2023 by the authors; licensee Online Academic Press, USA.},

	abstract = {Harbour Energy began offshore exploration in the Andaman Sea in North Sumatra, Indonesia with the Timpan-1 well. During the planning phase, reservoir sections of the well were identified that contained circa 5-15% of CO2 levels as per the offset well data, which are corrosive environments and can cause cement sheath degradation. This paper presents the decision process used in selecting a suitable system for the CO2rich environment and the first-time application of pumping novel self-healing and CO2-resistant cementing system with its capability to self-heal upon contact with CO2. Conventional Portland cement degrades in CO2-corrosive environments and combined with cement sheath damage by downhole stresses, long-term well integrity will be compromised. The auto repair capabilities provided by the novel cement system when in contact with CO2 leaking-fluids ensure long-term well integrity. Although self-healing-to-hydrocarbons cements have been widely used in the industry, use of this newly developed novel self-healing CO2-resistant cement was implemented for the first time in a primary casing job. To ensure blend consistency of the novel self-healing CO2-resistant cement, a number of quality control processes were developed with extensive laboratory testing and implemented for the complete blend lifecycle management. Implementation of this novel self-healing CO2-resistant cement in a deep-water primary casing job requires validation of crucial factors meet the requirements of achieving the long term well integrity. During the preparation phase, this cementing system was exposed to a high-CO2 corrosive environment over an extended period to analyze the robustness. The results showed superior properties compared with a conventional Portland system. The self-healing properties, analyzed with the use of an actual crack in the set cement and observed to the point where the crack closed, demonstrated continued cement integrity. Slurry stability tests produced excellent results. Blend flowability and robustness tests were performed at a regional laboratory using specialized equipment and determined the blend to be suitable for offshore operations. In implementation phase, by adhering to the project management process developed, the primary casing cement job was successfully performed without incident using conventional cementing equipment and practices. Good cement bond was obtained across the main zone, and the rig was able to continue its operations to perforate and well test the well. The 2001 Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol's guidelines categorized business GHGs as scope 1 emissions, scope 2 emissions, and scope 3 emissions. The aim of this emission classification system was to help organizations measure and manage their carbon footprint (www.greenbusinessbureau.com 2022). Scope 1 emissions are GHGs released directly from a business. Scope 2 emissions are indirect GHGs released from the energy purchased by an organization. Scope 3 emissions are also indirect GHG emissions, accounting for upstream and downstream emissions from a product or service, and emissions across a business's supply chain. The novel self-healing CO2-resistant cement produces 63% less CO2 compared with a conventional Portland cement system. Implementing the novel slurry system will significantly reduce Scope 3 of CO2 emission that is embedded during the manufacturing of the materials used. In addition to that, due to its self-healing capability, the novel CO2-resistant cement will contribute on Scope 1 CO2 emission reduction by eliminating the need to perform remedial work in case of a well leak. The solution meets the long-term well integrity requirement and is in line with the global commitment to reduce the carbon emission footprint. Copyright © 2023, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The high rate of urbanization, dependence on private vehicles, and less integrated transportation systems in Jakarta's metropolitan city and surrounding areas (called 'Jabodetabek' or Greater Jakarta) make congestion a chronic problem. Some challenges, such as the distance to stations/stops of mass public transport services beyond walking distance and the first-mile/last-mile public transportation is neither widely available nor reliable, have resulted in difficulties for existing public transport users to commute. This study aims to understand the role of ride-hailing on commuters’ multimodal journeys in Greater Jakarta, particularly in its role in complementing mass transportation. Face-to-face interviews with 5,064 commuters at mass transport service stations selected randomly and proportionally based on the number of commuters for each mass transport service were conducted from the end of December 2019 until the beginning of March 2020. A descriptive analysis describes the commuters’ profiles, their multimodal and multi-segment trips, and their ride-hailing use for their journeys. Ride-hailing has a complementary role to mass transport users, with almost half of them using the service for the first-mile and/or last-mile part of their journeys. Important factors affecting their decisions are identified, of which the top five are factors related to the service quality of mass transport and aspects related to access to ride-hailing services. An environmental impact analysis was conducted by comparing the GHG emissions of commuters’ current and previous main mode choices. The role of ride-hailing for first-mile/last-mile is essential to influence the shift from using private vehicles to mass public transportation, which eventually can reduce emissions. Several recommendations are provided to policymakers, mass transport operators, and ride-hailing service providers to create a seamless multimodal journey for commuters. © 2022 World Conference on Transport Research Society},

	abstract = {Electrification of all sectors needs net zero electricity (NZE) to slash greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), 38% of the global annual energy-related GHG of 34 Gt CO2eq. NZE is to avoid climate catastrophe, predicted at 2.7 °C rise in global mean temperature by 2100 (at 50% probability). There is no consensus approach to the sustainable development of NZE systems. This study has developed a novel, rigorous, holistic life cycle assessment methodology for a sustainable NZE roadmap or pathway. It identifies the leading fifteen countries with the highest gross domestic products with over 90% GHG. It compiles Ecoinvent life cycle inventory for in-country NZE systems and calculates their life cycle impacts using ReCiPe, Impact 2002+, and Environmental Prices methods. The global mean ranking of non-fossil systems is (kg CO2eq/GJ, US$/GJ): hydro-run-of-river (1.49, 0.73), hydro-reservoir (7.77, 0.91), wind:1–3 MW (7.37, 3.9), solar-20MW (13.94, 4.18), solar-50MW (15.29, 4.84), wind:>3 MW (9.55, 9.68), geothermal (19.99, 9.84), and bioenergy (12.09, 36.28). In decreasing order of significance, sustainability determinants are particulate emissions, land use, human toxicity, climate change, acidification, and ionisation radiation. To hit NZE (0.02–0.24 kg CO2eq/kWh), Brazil, the USA, Spain, Germany, France, Canada, Japan, Italy, and the UK need 52–95% decarbonization. Russia, Indonesia, Mexico, and Turkey can achieve 61%, 31%, 6%, and 4% decarbonization to 0.24–0.56 kg CO2eq/kWh, while with 0.52 and 0.65 kg CO2eq/kWh, China's and India's transitioning may slow down by this time. Robust NZE relies on improving health in developing countries, de-fossilized resource-technology diversification, and natural soil organic carbon sequestration, enhancing biodiversity and forestation. © 2021},

Of course, the negative impacts it causes accompany the fires that occur, such as on health, economic development, social relations, relations between countries, and so on, including the production of greenhouse gas emissions produced during fires, especially on peat land. The results of research and field observations confirm that although the laws and regulations require corporations to construct canal blocks, monitor ground water levels, equip their business areas with fire control facilities and infrastructure, and so on, it turns out that many do not fulfil their obligations, carried out by corporations, including those that often state that they care about the environment the most in the public as well as corporations with investments from abroad. Not to mention what happened on community land where it was proven that the burning was not only a matter of the stomach but had a business nuance, where the fire was no longer 2 ha as legalized for indigenous or traditional communities, but there were already hundreds of ha. This fact confirms that the forest and land fires that occur ensure that not all obligations have been fulfilled and implemented. Not to mention that many district/city or provincial governments are still stuttering in carrying out control activities in the field, as a result of the unavailability of sufficient funds is also not a priority. © 2022 Institute of Physics Publishing.

In recent years, the impact of climate change is increasingly affect the world community. Various studies state that the factor that exacerbates climate change comes from massive human activities, causing the production of the increasing of greenhouse gases. The growth in population and rapid urbanization causes urban expansion. Land conversion is unavoidable, escalates pressure on the environment, causing hydrometeorological disasters such as floods to occur more frequently. Some of them even claimed many lives and caused material losses.

	abstract = {The increase in industrial activities is followed by an increase in complex environmental problems, such as air pollution due to factory exhaust fumes, which are mostly produced in industrial areas such as in Surabaya, Indonesia. Based on data from iqair.com, three industrial areas in Surabaya fall into the category of moderate to unhealthy sensitive groups. The Tandes industrial area is in the unhealthy category for sensitive groups with an AQI index of US 104. Meanwhile, Kertajaya and Benowo are in the moderate category with US AQI indexes of 61 and 86 respectively. It is necessary to implement a green economy program. The existing renewable energy power plants in Indonesia will support the industry to switch to the use of electricity-based machines from renewable energy which will reduce air pollution that causes greenhouse gas emissions. The purpose of this study is to analyze the factory environment and application of a green economy through the use of electricity-based machines. Qualitative method is employed in this study. The results showed that the application of electricity-based machines can reduce the level of air pollution in Surabaya and potentially increase renewable energy in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Presently, Indonesia aims to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) from 29 to 40% before 2030 by growing the use of renewable energy. One of the sources of renewable energy is geothermal by expanding the development in several locations. This study, therefore, aims to examine the public knowledge, attitude, and perception on the development of Geothermal Energy Power Generation in Mount Lawu, Central of Java. This descriptive and qualitative research showed that most people's understanding of geothermal energy was insignificant. Therefore, the result showed that the majority perception had limited knowledge in geothermal energy. During this research, the local government had not implemented the Mount Lawu geothermal energy generation development. The community and local government are considering the pros and cons of the project, which is the main reason for the project implementation delay. Furthermore, the responses in addressing the geothermal plant project generally fell into three categories: agree, disagree, and doubt. There is some Society's consent that formed based on accepting the positive side of the plant. Furthermore, the initial negative response was due to their poor relationship with the project activities and the absence of prior information. Another factor was their sense of fear and doubt on the positive impacts of the project shortly. © 2022 Novel Carbon Resource Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Palm kernel shell (PKS) utilization for power generation has greatly increased in Japan since the introduction of the feed-in tariff (FIT) in 2012. However, the FIT fails to consider the entire palm industry while evaluating the environmental impacts of using PKS. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the life-cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions of power generation using PKS. We targeted two PKS-firing power plants as these are the first two instances of the use of PKS in power plants in Japan. A system boundary was established to cover palm plantation management in Indonesia and Malaysia, as both power plants import PKS from these countries. The GHG emissions were derived from land-use change, palm plantation, oil extraction, PKS transportation, and power plants. Six scenarios were examined for the emissions based on the type of land-use change and the existence of biogas capture in oil extraction. CO2 emissions from PKS combustion were also calculated by assuming that carbon neutrality was lost because of cultivation abandonment. The GHG emissions in one scenario, where the plantations were replanted and continuously managed and no biogas capture implemented in oil extraction, exhibited an average of 0.134 kg-CO2eq/kWh reduction in a plant in Kyushu District, and 0.043 kg-CO2eq/kWh reduction in a plant in Shikoku District for liquid natural gas-fired steam power generation, respectively. More than 65% of life-cycle GHG emissions originate from biogas generated during oil extraction; thus, biogas capture is an effective strategy to reduce current emissions. In contrast, in the case of accompanying land-use change or collapse of carbon neutrality, the emissions considerably exceeded those of fossil fuels. These findings indicated that the FIT fails to consider the risk of increased emissions or further substantial emission reductions. Therefore, the feasibility of FIT application to PKS needs to be re-established by evaluating the entire PKS life cycle. © 2022 The Authors. GCB Bioenergy published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Regional sea level rise in the southeast Indian Ocean (SEIO) exerts growing threats to the surrounding Australian and Indonesian coasts, but the mechanisms of sea level rise have not been firmly established. By analyzing observational datasets and model results, this study investigates multidecadal steric sea level (SSL) rise of the SEIO since the mid-twentieth century, underscoring a significant role of ocean salinity change. The average SSL rising rate from 1960 through 2018 was 7.4 6 2.4 mm decade21, and contributions of the halosteric and thermosteric components were ∼42% and ∼58%, respectively. The notable salinity effect arises primarily from a persistent subsurface freshening trend at 400–1000 m. Further insights are gained through the decomposition of temperature and salinity changes into the heaving (vertical displacements of isopycnal surfaces) and spicing (density-compensated temperature and salinity change) modes. The subsurface freshening trend since 1960 is mainly attributed to the spicing mode, reflecting property modifications of the Subantarctic Mode Water (SAMW) and Antarctic Intermediate Water (AAIW) in the southern Indian Ocean. Also noteworthy is a dramatic acceleration of SSL rise (20.3 6 7.0 mm decade21) since ∼1990, which was predominantly induced by the thermosteric component (16.3 6 5.5 mm decade21) associated with the heaving mode. Enhanced Ekman downwelling by surface winds and radiation forcing linked to global greenhouse gas warming mutually caused the depression of isopycnal surfaces, leading to the accelerated SSL rise through thermosteric effect. This study highlights the complexity of regional sea level rise in a rapidly changing climate, in which the role of ocean salinity is vital and time-varying. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.},

The amount of future warming Earth will depend on how much carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases we emit in the coming decades. in developing countries such as Indonesia. With the industrial era, 4.0 will increase greenhouse gases produced that can impact global warming. The current system only detected carbon dioxide in the shelter to report monthly and without the detail of the carbon-contributing sources. This research will develop a low-cost sensor (LCS) that can later be installed in urban areas or high-end supplement systems. Knowing the level of carbon gas in the observation is very important to predict and monitor greenhouse gas and global warming. This system observed carbon dioxide gas concentration from carbon dioxides gas. The system was designed using NDIR (Non-Dispersive Infrared Sensor) with additional temperature and humidity sensors to get related parameters that affected the carbon dioxide concentration. The microcontroller unit in this system receives from all sensors and is sent to a real-time database on the Firebase IoT Platform.

	abstract = {Improper discard of oil palm trunk and empty fruit bunch renders massive greenhouse gases. Turning these palm wastes into solid biofuels could aid in carbon reduction. The embodied environmental impacts of the solid biofuel densification process are neglected in carbon emission quantification studies applying Greenhouse Gas Protocol while the significance of classifying the system's direct and indirect carbon emissions were overlooked in those utilising life cycle assessment. Despite the prospect of both methodologies to complement their limitations for carbon emissions quantification, no study integrates both methodologies to investigate direct and indirect emissions systematically from a life cycle perspective. An integrated framework of life cycle assessment and Greenhouse Gas Protocol is developed to quantify the direct and indirect carbon emissions of oil palm trunk and empty fruit bunch densification from cradle-to-gate for three pellet plants in Indonesia and Malaysia. The emissions are categorised into three emission scopes: Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3 according to the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, integrated with avoided emissions which are quantified via life cycle assessment. The pellet plants generate 534.7–732.3 kg CO2-eq/tonnepellet per hour, in which Scope 1 (i.e., direct emissions) is the major emission scope due to high emissions from wastewater production and drying fuel combustion. Washing equipment (169.2–439.0 kg CO2-eq/tonnepellet per hour) and burners (87.1–214.5 kg CO2-eq/tonnepellet per hour) are the hotspots found in the pellet plants. Producing empty fruit bunch pellets could reduce 62.0–74.1 % of emissions than landfilling the empty fruit bunch. Empty fruit bunch pellet and oil palm trunk pellet are recommended to co-fire with coal to phase down coal usage in achieving COP26 pledge. This study provides data-driven insights for quantifying carbon emissions through the integrated framework and could be a reference in future life cycle carbon footprint studies of the biomass densification process. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Indonesia's energy generation sector produces 34% of Indonesia's total Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. So new ways of energy generation are needed to ensure the energy produced is clean from GHG such as renewable energy. For this reason, Hutama Karya is trying to develop core technology in the development of renewable energy in Indonesia. The core technology in question is the High RPM Small Dimension Permanent Magnet Generator. This PMSG has unique operating characteristics in the form of high RPM but low torque, making it suitable for application to renewable energy generation. The biggest challenge today is to ensure that the existing manufacturing technology in Indonesia is sufficient to produce the PMSG. Our findings indicate that manufacturing technology in Indonesia is sufficient to produce PMSG with 100 kW power capacity. It is indicated by the result of early testing that the generator can produce Electrical Coefficient (EC) value of 0.15. © 2023 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper explores factors affecting vulnerability to climate-related CO2 emissions and options for adaptation to climate change in sub-Sahara African and Southeast Asian countries. The STIRPAT model used in the methodology proves that significant causes of carbon dioxide emissions are different in two regions: agriculture-forestry and fishing. The human development index has solid explanatory power on CO2 emissions in Southeast Asian countries. The income per capita positively and significantly influences carbon emissions in sub-Saharan Africa but was statistically insignificant in the Southeast Asian countries. The population growth decreases CO2 emissions in the sub-Saharan African countries while not statically significant in the Southeast Asian countries. Besides, the estimation results showed a lower level of CO2 emissions in the sub-Saharan African countries relative to the Southeast Asian countries. These regions should not follow the same example to achieve a green economy because the effects of CO2 emissions are not felt uniformly. Copyright © 2021 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

	abstract = {The impact of global warming caused by the increasing CO2 concentrations has emerged as one of the most critical issues to be globally addressed. The top two sectors contributing to the country's emissions are forestry and energy, emissions from deforestation, and power generation. Most of the fuel used in petroleum and coal are identified as contributors to Indonesia's CO2 emissions. This study employs a comprehensive modelling tool, the GAINS energy planning system, to project CO2 emissions from 1990 to 2050 for each sector. Furthermore, it is compared with projections from Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT, Badan Pengkajian dan Penerapan Teknologi) of Indonesia and the Secretariat General of the National Energy Council (SGNEC) to find out which energy sector is the largest contributor to CO2 emissions. Then a projection was made using the Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) model for CO2 data at the GAW station, West Sumatra. Actual and projected data show that the CO2 concentrations were above 400 ppm, which had the potential to cause global warming. The government is recommended to use this projection as an effort to reduce global warming. The Indonesian government, with The Paris Agreement, is willing to reduce CO2 emissions by 41% by 2030. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The use of reverse osmosis (RO) desalination plant powered by a photovoltaic (PV) system is an attractive solution for small-scale applications in Madura Island (Indonesia). In this paper, the techno-economic feasibility of a small-scale grid-connected PV-RO desalination plant has been carried out in Madura Island for a plant capacity of 11.6 m3/day. The RO brine concentrate is utilized for valuable salt production-via-evaporation ponds that allowed the reduction of the required size in the conventional salt evaporation ponds. The steady-state numerical model of the RO desalination plant was used to predict the plant's performance using the characteristics of commercial RO elements. The PV array simulation was carried out using a dynamic modelling and simulation program based on weather data of Madura Island. The result illustrates that the production of potable water and salt using a community-scale grid-connected PV-RO plant is economically viable to be implemented in the region. The payback period of this PV-RO plant is around 4 years for a considered plant lifetime of 25 years with an annual solar contribution of 84 %. The Levelized cost of water production using the PV-RO plant is about 9.0 USD/m3 which is more cost-effective than the current cost of potable water in the region. Besides, the use of solar-assisted RO desalination plants in water-stressed regions such as Madura Island allows for mitigating the greenhouse gas emissions associated with seawater desalination. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, it is necessary to study the environmental impact of multi-feedstock biodiesel production. This study assesses the environmental performance of the simulated production of multi-feedstock biodiesel and compares it to palm oil biodiesel production in Indonesia. Generally, the life cycle of multi-feedstock biodiesel production has a higher environmental impact at the plantation stage than palm oil biodiesel production. The land-use change of scrubland into plantations of multiple crops (soybean, canola, sunflower, oil palm) showed a contribution of 9.89 tCO2 GHG emissions per tonne of biodiesel produced whereas as that into only oil palm plantation obtained a value of −3.43 tCO2. Many of the environmental impacts such as ecotoxicity, eutrophication, acidification, and global warming are related to plantation activities, particularly due to the use of fertilisers. The cultivation of multiple crops is more detrimental to the environment than the oil palm alone because they use more fertilisers. The use of soybean, canola, and sunflower to produce multi-feedstock biodiesel is not recommended because it provides a higher environmental burden than palm oil biodiesel. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Given that there was a dearth of information on fish-processing industrial wastewater in Indonesia, site surveys were conducted. For the entire fish-processing industry throughout the country, the dissemination rate of wastewater treatment facilities was less than 50%. Using a co-benefit approach, a real-scale swim-bed technology (SBT) and a system combining an anaerobic baffled reactor (ABR) with SBT (ABR–SBT) were installed in a fishmeal processing factory in Bali, Indonesia, and the wastewater system process performance was evaluated. In a business-as-usual scenario, the estimated chemical oxygen demand load and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from wastewater from the Indonesian fish-processing industry were 33 000 tons per year and 220 000 tons of equivalent CO2 per year, respectively. On the other hand, the GHG emissions in the co-benefit scenarios of the SBT system and ABR–SBT system were 98 149 and 26 720 tons per year, respectively. Therefore, introducing co-benefit-type wastewater treatment to Indonesia's fish-processing industry would significantly reduce pollution loads and GHG emissions. © 2023 Hohai University},

	abstract = {Purpose: This paper aims to evaluate the collaboration quality performance of sugar company Z and its stakeholders (farmers and distributors) by considering the sustainability aspects. This assessment shall be able to integrate qualitative and quantitative factors in the model, which is critical in sugar supply chains involving multi-stakeholders. Design/methodology/approach: Integration of quality function deployment (QFD), the fuzzy analytical network process (FANP) and the data envelopment analysis (DEA) is administered to assess the efficiency score of each stakeholder involved. The evaluation encompasses collaboration behaviour factors since the input of collaboration activities will result in sustainability aspects such as revenue, green house gas (GHG) emissions and social impact. The analysis has been conducted in two scenarios, those are the basic scenario by utilising original data and the extended scenario by using projection data. Findings: The result clarifies that the most influential behaviour factor in the collaboration activities is commitment (0.116), while the least important behaviour factors are power (0.008) and adaptation (0.008). Furthermore, by using the extended scenario, the overall efficiency for each benchmarking is higher compared to the condition before the improvement (basic scenario). Research limitations/implications: The result of this study is only relevant to the particular sugar supply chain and involving limited sustainability variables. Therefore, in a further study, more variables such as technical and financial aspects could be explored further in the assessment process. Practical implications: The result of this study is available for each stakeholder and can be fundamental for the constant improvement in sustainable supply chain (SSC) practices. It shows that an improvement of one stakeholder will positively impact the entire system. Social implications: Smallholders and sugarcane farmers will recognise the significance of collaboration behaviour. Thus, they can enhance their mutual benefits by using the existing resources. Originality/value: This paper arranges for a practical contribution by implementing advanced assessment methods in the sugar supply chain by taking into account the economic, environmental and social aspects. This comprehensive assessment process in the sugar supply chain is the novelty of this paper. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.},

	abstract = {Reducing CO2 emissions is essential for mitigating the effects of climate change. Carbon capture and utilization (CCU) has been considered as a potential strategy for mitigating CO2 emissions, and methanation is one of the most promising CCU technologies which should be investigated for implementation in Japan. In this study, the economic feasibility and CO2 reduction potential of the methanation process in Japan was comprehensively evaluated, considering the country's regional energy characteristics. Herein, process simulation was employed to optimize a methanation process that can improve the energy efficiency of the entire process, contributing to total CO2 emission reduction. Moreover, to identify the most suitable conditions for the implementation of the methanation in Japan, energy carrier types, CO2 emission sources, plant scales and locations, and international trading partners were comprehensively evaluated. The results show that liquefied CO2 is more economically efficient than liquefied H2 as an energy carrier. Indonesia was identified as Japan's optimal trading partner. When introducing methanation in Japan, CO2 capture should first be introduced at liquid natural gas (LNG)-fired power plants at a CO2 reduction cost of 474.6-479.8 USD·tCO2-1. In the medium-long term, coal fired power plants is predicted to be the most effective if H2 production cost decrease. A maximum CO2 reduction potential of 293.7 (Mt·y-1) occurs when conducting methanation by CO2 from coal-, BFG-, and LNG-fired power plants in Japan. However, as the domestic supply of renewable energy in Japan is limited, international cooperation is necessary to introduce methanation at a large scale.  © 2022 Elsevier Ltd.},

	abstract = {Environmental and economic issues in the maritime transportation and logistics industry have historically received less stakeholder attention than aviation and overland freight sectors. Stakeholders in the port industry have gradually started paying attention to emissions and cost issues across all the sectors, such as supply chains. Global biomass supply chain is one of the main sectors which has not been addressed in published literature. To address this gap, this study aims to develop a dynamic full-scale synergy model to assess cost-mass flow, particulate matter emissions, and air pollutants for maritime transportation of the global crude palm oil biomass supply chain. Focusing on leading producers of palm oil worldwide, we have analyzed a total of 93 sea routes from Malaysia and Indonesia to main export markets in the US, Europe, and Asia. The analysis distinguishes three freight categories: light, medium-weight, and heavy for different sizes of capacity and types of container ships based on the twenty-foot equivalent unit (TEU). The findings highlight the dependency of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions level on other factors such as technology, size, and mass flow used for container ships. The results also show a strong relationship between GHG emitted and the type of container ship in a systemic view. A ship with higher TEU contributes to the higher transported amount and lower GHG emissions in the long term. To conclude, the results would increase port industry stakeholders’ understanding of developing energy policies and managerial strategies for low cost and low carbon fuels technologies. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {While aquaculture is critical to global food and nutrition security, the fast development of aquaculture production systems has recently increased concerns about resource overexploitation and associated environmental impacts. Understanding how sustainable is current global aquaculture practice is important given its potential impacts on key sustainable development goals (SDGs). Here, for the first time, we developed a food-energy-water-carbon (FEWC) composite sustainability index (0–100) to assess the sustainability of global aquaculture across countries. Results indicate that the overall sustainability of global aquaculture is low (average score = 26) with none achieving a high sustainability score (75–100) and almost all practicing aquaculture in a relatively low sustainable way (0–50). Considering the sub-sustainability at a sector level, 80% of countries had at least two sectors among FEWC falling into the low sustainable zone (score less than 25). Regarding the environmental impacts, global aquaculture production accounted for approximately 1765.2 × 103 TJ energy use, 122.6 km3 water consumption, and 261.3 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions in 2018. China led all countries by contributing to more than half of global aquaculture water consumption and greenhouse gas emissions, followed by India and Indonesia. This study highlights the significance of cross-sectoral management and policymaking to achieve global aquaculture sustainability. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Nutmeg is an important spice and contributes significantly to the gross domestic product of Indonesia. The study examines the impact of climate change on Indonesia and the production of nutmeg over Banda Neira Island. For this, the outputs from high-resolution regional climate models under different representative concentration pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5), within the framework of Coupled Model Intercomparison Project 5/Coordinated Regional Climate Down-scaling Experiment-Coordinated Output for Regional Evaluations (CMIP5/CORDEX-CORE) over southeast Asia domain are employed. The representation of the spatial structure of rainfall and temperature climatology is found to be much better in ensembles as compared to individual model experiments. The behaviour of simulated rainfall and temperature from the model experiments is examined to check whether the projected climate favours an increase in nutmeg production. The study found that projected changes in the number of wet days (ideal 100–160 wet days), heavy rainfall events, rising mean temperature above the optimum temperature range (25–26°C), increasing heatwave spells, and prolongation of the warm period led to an unfavourable climate for nutmeg production. Based on the analysis of dynamically produced (model simulated) climate variables, the study rejects the forecasted increase in nutmeg production using a statistical regression model due to the unfavourable climatic conditions that are likely to affect the growth, production and quality of nutmeg. The changing climate not only reduces regional agricultural production but also impacts the socio-economic condition of the people of Indonesia. Therefore, the study emphasizes implementing stringent climate laws and policies at global, regional and local levels to curb greenhouse gas emissions and reduce the negative impact of climate change. © 2023 Royal Meteorological Society.},

	abstract = {The energy crisis, global warming, emissions, and greenhouse gas effects have become a global issue and an urgent problem to be resolved. CO2 is One of the contributors to global warming. The operation of fossil energy generation produces CO2 significantly. This paper examines the use of land for renewable energy power plant and the impact. The operation of 648 MW renewable energy power plants can reduce CO2 emissions by 94.78% compared to the coal-fired power plants at the same capacity. However, the construction of renewable energy plants requires a much larger area, which is 44.89 to 78.51 times the land requirement for coal-fired power plants. So, land clearing for renewable energy power plants will result in a much larger loss of land absorption for CO2 emissions compared to coal-fired power plants. The use of plantation land can reduce CO2 emissions due to the total operation and clearing of land of 4,444,907.97 tons/year up to 4,452,016.56 tons/year compared to the construction of the coal-fired power plant, at the same capacity. The use of plantation land for the construction of renewable energy power plant reduces the impact of CO2 emissions by up to 95.39% compared to the construction and operation of the coal-fired power plants. © 2022 Nur Widi Priambodo et al.},

	abstract = {Oil palm plantations on peat and associated drainage generate sizeable GHG emissions. Current IPCC default emission factors (EF) for oil palm on organic soil are based on a very limited number of observations from young plantations, thereby resulting in large uncertainties in emissions estimates. To explore the potential of process-based modeling to refine oil palm peat CO2 and N2O EFs, we simulated peat GHG emissions and biogeophysical variables over 30 years in plantations of Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The DNDC model simulated well the magnitude of C inputs (litterfall and root mortality) and dynamics of annual heterotrophic respiration and peat decomposition N2O fluxes. The modeled peat onsite CO2-C EF was lower than the IPCC default (11 Mg C ha−1 yr−1) and decreased from 7.7 ± 0.4 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the first decade to 3.0 ± 0.2 and 1.8 ± 0.3 Mg C ha−1 yr−1 in the second and third decades of the rotation. The modeled N2O-N EF from peat decomposition was higher than the IPCC default (1.2 kg N ha−1 yr−1) and increased from 3.5 ± 0.3 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in the first decade to 4.7–4.6 ± 0.5 kg N ha−1 yr−1 in the following ones. Modeled fertilizer-induced N2O emissions were minimal and much less than 1.6% of N inputs recommended by the IPCC in wet climates regardless of soil type. Temporal variations in EFs were strongly linked to soil C:N ratio and soil mineral N content for CO2 and fertilizer-induced N2O emissions, and to precipitation, water table level and soil NH4+ content for peat decomposition N2O emissions. These results suggest that current IPCC EFs for oil palm on organic soil could over-estimate peat onsite CO2 emissions and underestimate peat decomposition N2O emissions and that temporal variation in emissions should be considered for further improvement of EFs. © 2022 The Authors},

The research location was determined purposively. The research subjects were the parties involved in the research, namely processing industry voters, while the object in this study was tofu processing using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. Data collection was carried out by interview and documentation methods. The results showed that the total greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from the life cycle of 1 kg of tofu products were 1.4343 kg CO2-eq. The emission value is due to the input inventory at the transportation stage, the extraction of soybean raw materials, which is the main cause for tofu products producing high emissions compared to other inventory results. The scenario for improvement at the transportation stage is to substitute fuel oil (BBM) with gas fuel (BBG) for truck, pick-up, and motorbike transportation. Improvement scenarios at the tofu processing stage, including the utilization of tofu liquid waste biogas, replacing the furnace with a boiler, and reducing electricity consumption for washing soybeans. Through the application of these alternatives will have the potential to reduce greenhouse gases (GHG). © 2022, Khon Kaen University, Research and Technology Transfer Affairs Division.

The priority location for enhancing carbon stock as the mitigation action is natural forests, such as Mount Halimun Salak National Park (MHSNP). The objectives of this research were to estimate vegetation cover changes in 2016, 2019, 2022, and to analyze the forestry programs affecting forest cover in MHSNP. This research used Landsat 8 satellite imagery. NDVI was categorized into five classes, specifically class 1 (the clouds/non-vegetation), class 2 (very low dense vegetation), class 3 (low dense vegetation), class 4 (moderately dense vegetation), and class 5 (highly dense vegetation). MHSNP vegetation cover consecutive in 2016, 2019 and 2022 is dominated by class 1 (35,94% or 31.508,45 ha), class 2 (30,86% or 27.053,73 ha), and class 5 (58,76% or 51.543,18%), respectively. In general, the large vegetation cover from 2016 to 2022 is increasing from 87.662,06 ha to 87.716,88 ha and is significantly denser. It might be caused by the success of the forestry program in MHSNP, such as increasing the rehabilitation area, tree adoptions, and restoration in collaboration with communities and companies. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Pulp and paper wood plantations are one of the substantial forestry estates in Indonesia that are usually integrated with a pulp and paper mill industry. The atmospheric condition of glasshouse gases that keep increasing primarily due to anthropogenic activities represent critical issues on human health and affect forest productivity. Therefore this study measured the atmospheric concentration of common glasshouse gases in the pulpwood plantation integrated with a pulp mill in Riau Province. Overly high concentration of some glasshouse gases in the atmosphere may cause issues and at an extreme level, may lead to the occurrence of acid rain that could affect forest health and productivity. This study employed the Ogawa Passive Sampler Method to determine the air concentration of common glasshouse gases, i.e., [SOx], [NOx], [NO2], and [O3] in different rotations and stand ages of Acacia crassicarpa and Eucalyptus pellita stands. The results showed that species, rotation age, and stand age affect the concentration of gaseous N in the plantations. The concentrations of [NOx] and [NO2] gases were higher in the old rotation than in the young rotation of A. crassicarpa stands. Those concentrations were also relatively higher in peat soil sites than in non-peat soil sites. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is the world's third largest rice producer, with most rice being cultivated (estimated 3.1 million ha) in Central Java. However, one of the environmental challenges in producing rice is greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice fields. Therefore, understanding the GHG emissions (methane and nitrous oxide) from the rice farming system is important for better management practices. The objective of this study is to estimate the GHG emissions supported by a satellite database, namely, the DeNitrification DeComposition (DNDC) model, at three regencies at Central Java, Indonesia, Cilacap, Karanganyar, and Pati, as well as the factors determining the emissions. The DNDC model was obtained from https://www.dndc.sr.unh.edu, which consists of three main submodels that worked together in simulating N2O and N2 emissions: (1) the soil-climate/thermal-hydraulic flux submodel, (2) the decomposition submodel, and (3) the denitrification submodel. The results showed that the N2O emissions from rice farming in Karanganyar, Cilacap, and Pati were 19.0, 18.8, and 12.8 kg N ha-1 yr-1, respectively, while they were 213.7, 270.6, and 360.6 kg C ha-1 yr-1 for CH4 emissions, respectively. Consecutive dry or high precipitation, which resulted in cumulative depleted or elevated soil moisture, respectively, along with warmer temperature likely promoted higher methane and nitrous oxide. Experimental fields for validating the model in accordance with various agricultural practices are suggested for further study. Overall, the DNDC model has successfully estimated the CH4 and N2O emissions in Central Java when incorporated with various secondary climatic and land management big data resources. © 2021, the Authors.},

	abstract = {In recent decades, catastrophic wildfire episodes within the Sumatran peatland have contributed to a large amount of greenhouse gas emissions. The El-Nino Southern Oscillation (ENSO) modulates the occurrence of fires in Indonesia through prolonged hydrological drought. Thus, assessing peatland vulnerability to fires and understanding the underlying drivers are essential to developing adaptation and mitigation strategies for peatland. Here, we quantify the vulnerability of Sumatran peat to fires under various ENSO conditions (i.e., El-Nino, La-Nina, and Normal phases) using correlative modelling approaches. This study used climatic (i.e., annual precipitation, SPI, and KBDI), biophysical (i.e., below-ground biomass, elevation, slope, and NBR), and proxies to anthropogenic disturbance variables (i.e., access to road, access to forests, access to cities, human modification, and human population) to assess fire vulnerability within Sumatran peatlands. We created an ensemble model based on various machine learning approaches (i.e., random forest, support vector machine, maximum entropy, and boosted regression tree). We found that the ensemble model performed better compared to a single algorithm for depicting fire vulnerability within Su-matran peatlands. The NBR highly contributed to the vulnerability of peatland to fire in Sumatra in all ENSO phases, followed by the anthropogenic variables. We found that the high to very-high peat vulnerability to fire increases during El-Nino conditions with variations in its spatial patterns occurring under different ENSO phases. This study provides spatially explicit information to support the management of peat fires, which will be particularly useful for identifying peatland restoration priorities based on peatland vulnerability to fire maps. Our findings highlight Riau’s peat-land as being the area most prone to fires area on Sumatra Island. Therefore, the groundwater level within this area should be intensively monitored to prevent peatland fires. In addition, conserving intact forests within peatland through the moratorium strategy and restoring the degraded peatland ecosystem through canal blocking is also crucial to coping with global climate change. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: To guide the transformation of food systems to provide for healthy and sustainable diets, countries need to assess their current diet and food supply in comparison to nutrition, health, affordability, and environmental goals. Objectives: We sought to compare Indonesia's food utilization to diets optimized for nutritional value and cost and to diets that are increasingly plant-based in order to meet further health and environmental goals, including the EAT-Lancet planetary health diet, to explore whether multiple goals could be achieved simultaneously. Methods: We compared 13 dietary scenarios (2 current, 7 optimized, 3 increasingly plant-based, 1 EAT-Lancet) for nutrient content, cost, greenhouse gas emissions (GHGe), and water footprints, using the FAO food balance sheet, Indonesia Household Income and Expenditure Survey household food expenditure, food composition, life cycle assessment, food losses, and trade data. Results: The diversity of modeled scenarios was higher than that of current consumption, reflecting nutritional deficiencies underlying Indonesia's burden of different forms of malnutrition. Nutrient intake targets were met best by nutrient- and cost-optimized diets, followed by the EAT-Lancet diet. Those diets also had high GHGe, although less than 40% of a scenario in which Indonesia would adopt a typical high-income country's diet. Only the low food chain diet had a GHGe below the 2050 target set by the EAT-Lancet commission. Its nutrient content was comparable to that of a no-dairy diet, slightly above those of fish-and-poultry and current diets, and somewhat below those of the EAT-Lancet diets. To meet nutrient needs, some animal-source foods had to be included. Costs of all except the optimized diets were above the current national average food expenditure. No scenario met all goals simultaneously. Conclusions: Indonesia's consumption of rice and unhealthy foods should decrease; food production, trade, and processing should prioritize diversification, (bio)fortification, and limiting environmental impacts; and consumer and institutional demands for healthy, nutritious, and sustainable foods should be stimulated. More granular data and tools are required to develop and assess more detailed scenarios to achieve multiple goals simultaneously.  © 2021 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Research on the environmental impacts from the global value chain of plastics has typically focused on the disposal phase, considered most harmful to the environment and human health. However, the production of plastics is also responsible for substantial environmental, health and socioeconomic impacts. We show that the carbon and particulate-matter-related health footprint of plastics has doubled since 1995, due mainly to growth in plastics production in coal-based economies. Coal-based emissions have quadrupled since 1995, causing almost half of the plastics-related carbon and particulate-matter-related health footprint in 2015. Plastics-related carbon footprints of China’s transportation, Indonesia’s electronics industry and India’s construction sector have increased more than 50-fold since 1995. In 2015, plastics caused 4.5% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, 6% of global coal electricity is used for plastics production. The European Union and the United States have increasingly consumed plastics produced in coal-based economies. In 2015, 85% of the workforce required for plastics consumed by the European Union and the United States was employed abroad, but 80% of the related value added was generated domestically. As high-income regions have outsourced the energy-intensive steps of plastics production to coal-based economies, renewable energy investments throughout the plastics value chain are critical for sustainable production and consumption of plastics. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ancient hydrothermal vent complexes have released large volumes of greenhouse gases in the past causing global warming, and similar modern vent structures are potential geohazards. In the NE Atlantic, thousands of hydrothermal vent complexes were formed during the Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum. In Java, Indonesia, the erupting Lusi sediment-hosted geothermal system caused the displacement of 40,000 people. In order to determine how ancient and modern hydrothermal venting systems are related, we map a well-defined buried hydrothermal vent complex offshore mid-Norway using 3D seismic reflection data and then compare it to the active Lusi eruption (since 2006) and the neighboring inactive Porong Structure. These are characterized using 2D seismic reflection data, borehole data and field observations. The venting structures are subcircular in plan-view and a few kilometers in diameter. They are funnel-shaped in profiles, with inward-dipping beds surrounding the conduits. The hydrothermal vent complex offshore mid-Norway reveals five seismically-distinct vent fill facies units. Importantly, two of the facies units are separated by an angular unconformity, clearly indicating that the depositional events within the vent fill were distinct. Hydrothermal fluids are interpreted to have led to the fluidization of mud-rich sediments which were erupted and deposited in and around the vent complex. Interpretation of a seismically transparent body along the conduit of the Norwegian venting structure, and the abrupt widening of the conduit at the Porong Structure, are interpreted to be caused by changes in fluid-flow dynamics as the fluids rise and get released from the host-rock. The hydrothermal venting systems in Java and offshore mid-Norway are found to be morphologically similar and are interpreted to form as the result of the transport and eruption of fluidized sediments. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The climate catastrophe is being caused by human effects on earth system processes that are surpassing several planetary boundaries. This crisis is driven significantly by the global food system. It has been increasing over recent years, yet food systems are essential in upholding food and nutrition security. This study proposed a novel method for enumerating national contributions to the cessation of the climate crisis by approximating nations’ aggregate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from food systems, within the equitable and sustainable planetary boundaries of climate change. This study included 221 nations, which were grouped as per their human development index (HDI) categories, income groups, and continental locations. During 1990–2018, the annual fair share, overshoot of emissions, and collective historical responsibility in the world of each country were assessed. There was a 22.52% increase in overshooting of GHG emissions from the global food system, starting in 1990. A group of 15 countries, including Brazil, China, Indonesia, and the U.S.A., were responsible for >67% of global overshoot. The primary liability is borne by countries with upper-, middle-, and high-income economies, and high to very-high HDI groups, as well as Asia and South America. Countries such as India, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and others have steadily increased their share of responsibility over the last 28 years. More than 76% of countries in the world, mostly from Africa, Europe, and Asia, proved to be absolute overshooters. After contextualising the study’s findings, the global food system’s decarbonization and its limits were discussed; some recommendations for prospective research were also offered. It appears that academics, governments, and policymakers should start concentrating more on reshaping and redesigning the global food system to be climate-friendly (i.e., a carbon-neutral food system), whilst being able to fairly allocate food and nutrition security to achieve long-term Sustainable Development Goal 2 (SDG 2). © 2022 by the authors.},

Forest restoration efforts are also aimed at reducing CO2 emissions and are closely related to Indonesia's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) from the forestry sector. The purpose of this paper is to examine the regulatory, institutional, and policy aspects of forest restoration in Indonesia, as well as the implementation of forest restoration activities in the country. The article was written using a synoptic review approach to Forest Landscape Restoration (FLR)-related articles and national experiences. Failures, success stories, and criteria and indicators for forest restoration success are all discussed. We also discuss the latest silvicultural techniques for the success of the forest restoration program. Restoration governance in Indonesia has focused on the wetland ecosystem such as peatlands and mangroves, but due to the severely degraded condition of many forests, the government has by necessity opted for active restoration involving the planting and establishment of livelihood options. The government has adapted its restoration approach from the early focus on ecological restoration to more forest landscape restoration, which recognizes that involving the local community in restoration activities is critical for the success of forest restoration. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Education must provide substantive knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors toward environmental education. This study aims to identify seventh-grade students’ conceptions regarding climate change, global warming, and the greenhouse effect. The research was conducted at four local secondary schools in the Special Region of Yogyakarta, Indonesia. Data were gathered through open-ended questionnaires to 140 students, which were analyzed inductively to identify concepts and patterns. The result indicated that students believe that five harmful environmental behaviors cause global warming: (1) use of fossil fuels; (2) deforestation; (3) use of aerosols; (4) littering; and (5) air pollution. The five activities produce the greenhouse effect and deplete the ozone layer, which causes global warming. Global warming has an adverse impact on the earth’s ocean, soil, air, plants and animals, humans, weather, and season changes. The students’ thoughts were substantially linear and simplified: human activities cause global warming, impacting individuals through health risks, food preservation, and conservation. Appropriate human actions would reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) and global warming, thereby decreasing ecological problems. This research is expected to enhance and guide the effective implementation of environmental education concerning climate change issues because students’ conceptions and actions are crucial for sustainability. © 2021 National Association of Geoscience Teachers.},

The practice of plastic waste recycling in developing countries also does not pay attention to the Environment and is not energy and material efficient during the process. Andusti Simpari company in Bengkulu City is one of the small-scale plastic waste recycling companies that face common problems such as the use of human labor, inefficient energy, and lack of liquid waste management, which has the potential to cause eutrophication and produce greenhouse gases in the form of CO2 which can contribute to global warming. This study aims to assess the environmental impact of eutrophication and the global warming potential (GWP) of businesses using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) method. Cradle to grave LCA is applied to small-scale plastic waste recycling, with 1000kg of shredded plastic/day production capacity. From the LCA analysis, it is known that to produce 1 kg of shredded plastic can produce as much as 0.97363 KgCO2eq of pollutants that contribute to the Global Warming Potential (GWP) and eutrophication of 0.01492 kg PO4.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {This research had been conducted in Sampean Baru Watershed, Bondowoso-Situbondo Regency, Indonesia. The National Disaster Management Agency (BNPB) categorizes this watershed as an area that has a very high level of drought. This condition is likely to get worse and will have a broad impact on people's lives if global warming continues for the next few years, therefore, future drought assessment is needed to assist in decision making. This study aims to assess future drought using General Circulation Model data. The GCM data contains future climate change scenarios called the Representatives Concentration Pathway (RCP) as results of the Fifth Assessment Report-Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC-AR5) report. GCM data containing coarse-resolution climate parameters are processed using downscaling techniques, so predictive rainfall data with the fine resolution, and local scale are obtained. The rainfall data is used in Soil and Water Assessment Tools (SWAT) modelling to simulate discharge at Sampean Baru watershed. Furthermore, the Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) method with simulated discharge used as input data to assess the drought severity. The results showed that the drought severity using SRI gives high accuracy and can be used for predictions of drought in the future. The drought prediction results showed that increased greenhouse gas concentrations while earth's temperature on RCP scenarios have an influence the intensity of drought events and drought-affected areas. Scenarios of climate change based on the temperature increase contained in the RCP will have a real effect on the severity of drought. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Global agreements mandate the international community, including Indonesia, to commit to reducing the risks and impacts of climate change. Indonesia’s Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will contribute to the achievement of the Convention’s goals by reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing climate resilience. This commitment must be supported by a wide range of actions, including the use of timber. Despite the fact that wood contains carbon, limited information is currently available on the size of the wood utilisation subsector’s contribution to reducing GHG emissions. More research is needed on the magnitude of wood products’ contribution to climate change mitigation. This study assessed the amount of carbon stored in wood used as a building material. Purposive sampling was used to select the cities with rapid housing development surrounding Jakarta’s capital city, i.e., the Bekasi District, East Jakarta City, Depok City, and Bogor District. The amount of carbon stored in wood was calculated according to EN 16449:2014-06 and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS/EDX) analysis. Results show that wood is currently only used in door frames, door leaves, window frames, shutters, and vents. The carbon stored on the components ranges from 450 to 680 kg (average of 554.50 kg) in each housing unit, according to the EN 16449:2014-06 calculation. The weight range is between 130 and 430 kg (average of 400.42 kg) according to EDX/S carbon analysis. With an increase in housing needs of 800,000 units per year, this amount has the potential to store 0.44 million tons of carbon over the lifespan of the products. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Energy is a critical component in any given region's growth. India has the world's fourth-largest coal reserves. Therefore, energy generation from coal-based power plants is still a significant source of power in the country. However, the performance of Indian coals is poor compared to foreign coals such as South African, Indonesian, and US coals due to the high ash and moisture content. Seventy percent of country electricity need is still dependent on coal power even with known negative environmental consequences such as the production of CO2 & greenhouse gases, and air pollution caused by SOx, NOx, coal sludge, coal dust, and by-products of coal combustion. In this work, effect of coal types, particle sizes, and furnace temperatures on the ignition delay time of pulverized coal particle is investigated. In the current study, the ignition delay time of four Indian coals (IS1, IS2, IS3, and IS4), two Indonesian coals (IAS1 and IAS2), and one South African coal (SA1) were examined for particle sizes ranging from 35 to 115 µm, furnace temperature ranging from 1000 to 1700 K, and oxygen concentrations ranging from 12 to 20% in gas. Furthermore, ignition delay analysis of different coal mixtures (Indian and foreign coals mixtures) has also been studied. Numerical analysis of ignition delay time has been performed using MATLAB. Results show that the ignition delay time of coal particles increases with a decrease in furnace temperature and an increase in particle size. Results also show that the Indian coals have a larger ignition delay time than other considered coals, and ignition characteristics of Indian coals can be enhanced by mixing with high-grade ones. An increase in oxygen concentration also reduces the ignition delay time of the coals. © 2021},

	abstract = {Tropical forest conservation is critical for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining global ecosystems. Understanding the channels through which conservation affects agricultural activities and livelihoods in these regions is key to designing effective policies and promoting sustainable development. To this end, we use labor supply data from Indonesia in 2007 and 2015 combined with a matching strategy to estimate the impacts of a national forest conservation policy, the forest moratorium, on local agricultural labor. Consistent with the predictions of our theoretical model, we find robust empirical evidence that the moratorium increased local agricultural employment and slowed structural transformation away from the agricultural sector. We provide corresponding evidence of decreased household expenditure due to the moratorium. Despite the moratorium, we find significant deforestation and forest degradation within the boundaries of the moratorium-targeted areas, suggesting that increases in local agricultural employment may partly dampen the conservation policy's effectiveness. Our work offers new insights into evaluating existing conservation policies and designing future policies for Indonesia and other resource-dependent economies that face similar challenges in balancing economic growth with conservation. © 2022 Agricultural & Applied Economics Association.},

	abstract = {Depleting stockpile of fossil fuels and rising global temperature due to the greenhouse effect are probably the two most threatening factors to civilization sustainability. Converting biomass into a readily available energy source will help reduce dependency on fossil fuels, whilst at the same time moderating greenhouse gas emmissions due to its carbon neutrality. Palm oil industry is the largest source of biomass in Indonesia and the available quantity to be utilized is growing inline with the steady growth of the generating industry. Among various wastes from palm oil processing, palm kernel shell is an oil palm biomass with high potential to be applied as a source of energy, given its high caloric value and distinctive physical properties. This source of renewable energy can be utilized by industries with thermal conversion processes. As a prerequisite, a feasibility study on technical, environmental, and economic aspects needs to be carried out. From long term perspective, supply, demand, and regulatory situational analysis will also be required. Lastly, a review on the existing palm kernel shell supply chain will help to understand its current situation. Based on literature studies and field observations, we have identified supply and demand characteristics that will be valuable in constructing an effective, efficient, and sustainable supply chain model of palm kernel shell. Understanding these characteristics is a precursor in realizing this massive potential of renewable energy source in the industrial context. © 2022. The Authors. Published by CBIORE.},

	abstract = {The problem of rice farming in Indonesia is the increasing extent of nutrient-poor land due to the lack of addition of organic matter and continuously inundated irrigated rice fields, causing the production of greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane gas (CH4), to increase. The study aims to determine the impact of organic fertilizers and rice varieties on rice yield, methane emissions, and the feasibility of farming in nutrient-poor rice fields. The study used a randomized block design in factorial with four replicates. The first factor is the type of organic fertilizers (compost of rice straw and goat manure), and the second factor is the variety of rice (Ciherang, Inpari 20, and Inpari 30). The results showed that the productivity of Inpari 20 (8.02 t·ha−1) was significantly higher than that of Inpari 30 (6.10 t·ha−1) and Ciherang (6.91 t·ha−1). The highest yields of Harvest Dry Grain (HDG) to Milled Dry Grain (MDG) were the Inpari 20 (88.23%), Inpari 30 (86.94%), and Ciherang (85.04%). Methane (CH4) emissions were highest in the Ciherang variety (56.4 kg h−1 season−1), followed by Inpari 30 (40.8 kg h−1 season−1), and lowest in Inpari 20 (22.3 kg h−1 season−1). Compared to Inpari 30 and Ciherang varieties, the Inpari 20 variety with rice straw compost has broad development viability in nutrient-poor paddy fields (highest R/C ratio and break-even point). More research on organic rice is needed to determine the productivity and emissions (methane, nitrite, carbon dioxide). © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Energy is an essential indication of productivity, usage, and nation-building in the development context. However, energy diversity that emphasizes renewables is still vital for economic development in emerging nations. This study examines the impact of renewable energy on economic development in emerging and growth-leading economies (EAGLE’s) from 1980 to 2019. The econometric procedure used in this study is pooled mean group regression/Panel ARDL approach. The study’s results support the growth-conservation theory and demonstrate that wealth creation is not dependent entirely on fossil fuels and that other energy sources may also be used. There is a positive association between renewable energy production and consumption and economic development in EAGLE countries. For the overall sample selected, the association between the long run and short is positive and significant, whereas individual analysis for each country provided mixed results. In the short run, the association between renewable energy consumption and economic development for Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Philippines is negative. While in production, most countries showed positive and significant results except Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Russia. The result of this study will help policy makers from the selected countries towards the use of renewable energy production and consumption, its importance and contribution to the economic development of these countries. However, some countries showed a negative relationship particularly Russian economy is rich in natural resources (oil, natural gas). While the remaining countries that showed negative relationship have number of problems associated with renewable energy consumption and production. This study refers the attention of policy makers from developing countries to consider the potential impact of renewable energy for the economic development. Energy transition can also contribute to the environmental protection and the reduction of greenhouse gases. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Biomass residue is one of the focus areas for green energy in Indonesia, elaborated in Government Regulation no 79 the year 2014 on national energy development. The assessment of residual resources is an important way to show the availability distribution to realize the target of biofuel is more than 5% of the energy supply in 2025. Thus, this paper will present a method to assess the energy production from biomass residue as a primary consideration in its development. Statistical data and field observations have been used to estimate the total availability of residue. Furthermore, to calculate the energy potential of biomass residue, the minimum and maximum value parameters, such as residue to product ratio, moisture content, and heating value, were obtained from works of literature. The power potential was also analyzed through three scenarios of the conversion factor efficiency, i.e., low, medium, and high, to provide comprehensive results. The proposed methods allow the annual Indonesian biomass residue production from agriculture and forest residue to be nearly 155,271 and 2554 tonnes, respectively. It can be generated an energy potential around 1261 PJ, covering 22.12% of national energy consumption. Given the high potential for sustainability in biomass residue supply and utilization, strategic factor in the areas of the government regulation and policy, greenhouse gasses emission, land-use change, and conversion technology were identified to support residue valorization in the context of planning, organizing and operating. The challenges and barriers that can be minimized by integrated collaboration and synergy among policymakers, entrepreneurs, academics, and community to assist the sustainability of green energy production in the future, and evaluation of environmental, economic, and social analysis as a framework to improve the quality and quantity of the production processes. © 2022},

	abstract = {Under the Nationally Determined Commitment (NDC), Indonesia voluntarily reduces GHG emission by 29% compared to the BAU level in 2030. While the national economics itself is still growing and advancing, the mitigation policies are expected to slow down the economy at some level. This study is trying to examine the potential impact of the emission mitigation policies on the Indonesian economy by utilizing a dynamic computable general equilibrium (CGE). The simulation result showed that the implementation of comprehensive mitigation technology would cause a GDP loss of around 1.7% by 2030 compared to the BAU level. If we look at the sectoral GDP, the agriculture sector is projected to experiencing the most significant shock by the emission mitigation policies (− 13.4% compared to BAU level by 2030). But the energy sector might become a sector experiencing higher GDP under the mitigation action (3.5% compared to BAU level by 2030). It also showed that the utilization of renewable energies for power generation would increase significantly, especially after 2025, but still cannot fully replace the dominance of fossil fuel sources. There are several policy recommendations based on our simulation results, including that the government also needs to increase efficiency in using fossil fuels, especially coal and gas, during the process of building infrastructure for renewable energy utilization. In terms of employment, the government needs to prepare other sectors to absorb labor, especially from the agricultural sector. Another crucial thing is that considering the possible economic impact, especially in the mid-term period, the government needs to implement necessary mitigation policies immediately. Otherwise, the government may need to prepare more expenditure to introduce more technologies and policies in the future. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Indonesia has emerged into the largest palm oil-producing nation in just a few decades, leaving Malaysia behind. Undeniably, palm oil has substantially contributed to the country's economic development. Nonetheless, it comes with refutation for deforestation, environmental degradation, and social tensions, are also evident. The palm oil industry has been recognized as one of the major producers of greenhouse gases, including CO2. The Government of Indonesia (GOI) is committed to maintaining the palm oil industry, despite the strain of the European Union, as millions of workers depend on these industries for their livelihoods. The GOI requests that each palm oil firm pursue the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification regarding the adverse impacts. Around 20% of the country's entire palm oil industry has received an ISPO certificate. By 2023, all palm oil companies must be ISPO accredited, as this regulation is compulsory. By reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gasses, implementing all the ISPO guidelines in the palm oil industry will support the industry and protect the environment. This paper will review the implementation of sustainable Indonesia's palm oil industry under the current situation, corresponding with ISPO and RSPO (Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil).  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Net CO2 ha-1 of coffee plantation was 162.75 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1, with CO2 emission was 203.84 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1, CO2 reduction was 3.10 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1, and CO2 sequestration was 363.49 x 10-2 t CO2 e ha-1. This research formulates the calculation of equivalent carbon emissions in the arabica coffee production system in the field and primary processing, using various methods (remote sensing analysis and calculation of direct and indirect equivalent carbon emissions). The CO2 cycle positively impacts the sustainability of agroforestry and agroindustry of Gayo Arabica coffee. © 2023 Jordan Journal of Biological Sciences. All rights reserved - Volume 16, Number 2.

	abstract = {The transportation sector is one of the most significant contributors to CO2 emissions in Indonesia. The Indonesian government aimed to reduce 29% of its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2030. To reach this goal, the government aimed to increase renewable energy (RE) in the energy mix to 23% in 2025. They also initiated local production of electric motorcycles in 2025 and electric cars in 2030. Electric Vehicle (EV) is a promising technology that can increase electricity efficiency, drive RE, and diminish the dependency on fossil fuel in the mobility sector. The challenges, however, come not only from the technology and infrastructure readiness but also from market readiness. Although some countries that adopted EVs, such as China and Norway, showed success, the market penetration is not always easy. EVs adoption is influenced by many factors, both technical and individual-specific psychological factors. To reveal the readiness level in Indonesia, we interviewed the key EV stakeholders in Indonesia, such as the industrial sector, the experts, and the end-users. We assess their perceptions with the Japanese Technology Readiness Assessment (J-TRA) methodology to identify the bottleneck of EV technology readiness in Indonesia. Results showed that Market and Commercialization parameters have the weakest readiness levels. Efforts should be focused on these sectors to improve the EV readiness level in Indonesia. © 2023 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Under the Renewable Energy Directive (RED) II, the EU will phase out the use of palm oil for biodiesel feedstock. Environmental concerns are the main reasons for the EU to implement this initiative. This study analyzes the economic and environmental impact of EU import ban to Indonesia at provincial level, using 2 scenarios (a direct and direct-indirect import ban). The analysis is performed using a global-subnational Multi-Regional Input-Output (MRIO) with environmental extensions. This study shows that a direct (combined) import ban of palm oil by the EU will reduce Indonesia's GDP by −0.2 % (−0.26 %) and employment by −0.12 % (−0.54 %) from baseline. At provincial level, Riau, North Sumatra, Lampung, Central Kalimantan and South Kalimantan experience the highest impact on their domestic product (more than −0.5 %). Under a direct import ban, job losses mostly happen in outside Java (96.26 %) and in the oilseeds sector (75.21 %). Low and middle skilled jobs decline more than high skilled jobs and count for 95 % of the total loss. This study also shows that a direct (combined) import ban reduces national GHG emissions by −0.19 % (−0.24 %) and total land use by −0.48 % (−0.6 %). Potential carbon sequestration can be 34.55 (42.27) million tons C equivalent to 149.74 (182.67) million tons CO2e under assumption a full rewilding from the reduction of land use in oilseed. Our study shows that an EU import ban on Indonesian palm oil has relatively small economic and environmental impacts at national and provincial level. Yet, this policy can create potential carbon sequestration that can absorb CO2 by vegetation and soil. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Energy consumption in buildings contributes to an increase in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The high energy consumption of buildings is caused by electrical energy for artificial ventilation, lighting, and electronic equipment. Residential buildings are the most significant contributor to GHG due to electricity consumption for artificial ventilation. The use of electrical energy for air conditioning in Indonesia is predicted to continue to increase every year. This study aims to analyze the application of passive design in flats in Jakarta to optimize energy consumption. Due to their close location, the Rawa Bebek Flats and Pulo Gebang Flats are the objects of this research, which have similar building typologies and similar climatic conditions. The research was conducted by observing, analyzing secondary data, and calculating the Overall Thermal Transfer Value (OTTV). The results of the OTTV calculation show that residential units facing the west side get the highest thermal transfer, which is 37.35 Watt/m2. At the same time, the east side gets the lowest thermal transfer, which is 26.35 Watt/m2. In conclusion, the passive design strategy will impact the energy consumption of the building, so this aspect needs to be considered carefully since the planning stage.  © 2022 Author(s).},

	abstract = {To achieve sustainable production and consumption patterns in the modern world, emerging countries are concentrating more on how economic variables may employ carbon neutrality targets appropriately. Using renewable energy, structural changes initiative, and imposing environmental taxes are all part of the plan to achieve the carbon neutrality goal in terms of reduced carbon emissions (CO2), haze pollutants, and greenhouse gases (GHG). Environmental taxation, renewable energy, structural changes, trade openness, and foreign direct investment (FDI) are aspects taken into account in this study, along with the long-term viability of the natural ecology in the E7 (China, Turkey, India, Russia, Brazil, Indonesia, and Mexico) economies. The Driscoll Kraay fixed effect OLS technique and the Method-of-Moment quantile (MMQ) regression technique were adopted for the baseline analysis for the data span of 2000 to 2020. From the empirical analysis, it was discovered that environmental Tax, structure change, and renewable energy have a negative connection with carbon emissions for the understudy countries. Moreover, the pollutant haven hypothesis (PHH) was confirmed since the findings discovered a positively significant relation involving FDI and carbon emission. Similarly, trade openness was seen to have a positive connection with carbon emissions. Thus, it is concluded that effective environmental taxation, renewable energy enhancement, and structure changes mitigate pollution while trade openness and FDI inflow enhance carbon emission for the E7 economies. According to the results, rigorous environmental tax rules will enable enterprises to transition manufacturing to green and sustainable alternatives. Finally, the report recommends that transferring tax money to research and development of sustainable technology programmes will enable governments to meet the SDG-7 and SDG-13 objectives of the United Nations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {This study explores the relationship between carbon emission patterns and the land surface temperature (LST) changes due to the rapid urbanization in the Semarang Metropolitan Region (SMR), an Indonesian area that has experienced rapid urban growth compared to other urban areas. This research used the stock-difference and gain–loss methods to calculate carbon stocks and emissions. Then, band 6 on Landsat 5 TM (2008) and band 10 on Landsat 8 OLI (2013 and 2018) were used to calculate the LST changes. These results showed that the peri-urban area had a more significant change. The correlation between carbon emissions and an increased SMR temperature correlates to 0.646. This shows that the carbon emissions pattern promotes temperature dynamics in the SMR. Furthermore, this study proved the release of carbon emissions in line with LST dynamics spatially. In this case, this study proved that rapid urbanization in the SMR promotes both carbon emission and LST. Those changes are also affected by vegetation canopy availability and other activities. As a result, the government must prioritize spatial planning in the SMR to mitigate environmental change risk. In addition, the government must develop novel strategies to deal with a wide range of fast and unpredictable potential changes in the urban area and its surroundings. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Global warming and climate change are phenomena of increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to various human activities as a result of economic development activities. The success of economic development activities can be seen from the increase in the value of national output in the form of gross domestic income. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to determine the effect of economic development as measured by Gross Regional Domestic Product (GRDP) and population density to environmental quality in 33 provinces of Indonesia for the 2013-2018 period. The data in this study use GRDP of the agricultural sector, mining and quarrying, processing industry, transportation, population density and the environmental quality index (IKLH). In this study using panel data estimation. The research results show that the fixed effects method is the best method for estimating the existing variables. This research shows that the GRDP of the mining and quarrying sector has a negative and significant relationship with environmental quality in Indonesia. Then the GRDP variable in the transportation sector is positively and significantly related to the quality of the environment in Indonesia. Meanwhile, the variables of GRDP in the agricultural sector, GRDP in the transportation sector, and population density have no significant effect on the quality of the environment in Indonesia. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc..

	abstract = {The extraction of critical minerals used in clean technologies has profound impacts on sustainable development goals (SDGs). Life cycle sustainability assessment (LCSA) is used to evaluate the sustainability impacts of products and services, but few frameworks exist to support SDGs assessment for the “green minerals” extraction. Here, we propose a mining-specific framework identifying linkages between LCSA and SDGs, along with a process to integrate methods and data. As a proof of concept, we assess the LCSA performance and local-community level SDG impacts of a nickel mining project in Indonesia. Integrating remote sensing, media sources, stakeholder's data, and expert opinion, we find that LCSA encompasses all 17 goals but only a subset of targets and indicators. The study highlights the need to incorporate indigenous people's perspectives in both LCSA and SDG assessments, and points to priority areas for improving life cycle sustainability and SDG outcomes: fighting corruption, protecting cultural heritage, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. We suggest that this framework can inform corporate social responsibility activities, as well as consumer choices for low-carbon technologies. © 2022 by the International Society for Industrial Ecology.},

	abstract = {Purpose Takakura Composting Method (TCM) is a simple and cost-effective aerobic composting method using locally available materials and has been widely introduced in Indonesia and other countries. This study tracked the progress of scaling the TCM up to 1 tonne/day of organic waste input at the decentralised composting centre in Bandung City, Indonesia. A comparative study was conducted to assess the environmental and economic impacts by using the performance data of TCM. Method A combination of Life Cycle Assessment and Cost-Benefit Analysis were performed to compare the net greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and Net Present Value (NPV) of six different municipal solid waste treatment scenarios to treat 1 tonne of food waste. The impacts were also assessed between different system boundaries with or without compost use, and by applying different emission factors for composting to the static windrow and TCM. Results Home composting showed the least GHG emissions (-601 kg CO2-eq/t) and highest NPV (Indonesian Rupiahs (IDR) 518,790/tonne) and is thus suggested to be the most favourable option. While the least favourable options were either landfilling which showed the highest GHG emissions (628 kg CO2-eq/t), or incineration which showed the lowest NPV (IDR-818,373/tonne). Conclusion As the home composting was not considered to be a realistic option for wide application, a combination of one large centralised composting centre and a small decentralised composting centre in each sub-district is suggested in the case of Bandung City. © 2023, Islamic Azad University.

	abstract = {Using palm oil mill effluent (POME) to produce biogas is an alternative and sustainable way to control POME GHG emissions while also providing economic benefits. The increasing area of oil palm plantations encourages an increase in palm oil production and the generation of POME in Indonesia. This could increase potential GHG emissions and global warming. In contrast, biogas power plants from POME are less attractive for economic investment in Indonesia. However, as the world’s largest palm oil producer, Indonesia still lacks techno-economic and environmental studies of biogas power generation from POME. This study aimed to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental aspects of the biogas power generation from POME at the study site (Bangka Island, Indonesia). The result shows that the biogas plant at the study site can reduce COD levels of POME by up to 91% and produce biogas at 325,292 m3/month, with a 55% methane content. Biogas can be converted into electrical energy at 696,163 kWh/month. The operation of this biogas plant can reduce GHG emissions by 1131 tons CO2-eq/month, with low profitability (NPV of IDR—1,281,136,274, IRR 6.75%, and a payback period of 10.8 years). This evaluation proves that the main problem in the factory is the POME used, which is insufficient, and which could be overcome by purchasing POME from other palm oil mills. Furthermore, using the mesophilic anaerobic degradation process at the study site is feasible. However, a technological shift from closed lagoons to more efficient bioreactors is urgently needed, to increase the process efficiency and economic benefits. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Greenhouse gas or carbon emissions produced by manufacturing operations and other highly emitted industries are causes of global warming. Therefore, either in the sustainability reporting or in the corporate social and environmental reporting section, as stated in the annual report, the company usually discloses its activities related to carbon emission handling for sustainable business. In Indonesia, however, the extent of carbon emission disclosures is voluntary. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of audit committee characteristics, financial performance, and listing age on carbon emissions reporting of highly emitted companies in Indonesia. Audit committee characteristics were measured by the number of audit committee members and the number of audit committee meetings, while Altman financial distress model measured financial performance. A checklist based on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) evaluated the greenhouse gas emissions disclosures. This study uses 99 companies of highly emitted industry listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Results of multiple regression analysis indicate that the number of audit committee meetings positively affects the greenhouse gas emissions report. The result suggests that the more active the audit committee in the company in conducting meetings, the higher the company's incentives to disclose carbon emission in the company's annual report or the sustainability reporting. The study provides insight into the regulation released by the capital market authority agency regarding strengthening factors that may influence listed companies to report their carbon emission. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Alternate wetting-drying (AWD) is known to reduced water use and at the same time also reduced greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from rice fields. The research aimed at comparing AWD on contrast soil textures. Field experiments were conducted at two sites representing coarse-texture soil (silt loam) and finer-texture soil (silty clay) to study the efficiency of AWD on water use, methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emission, grain yield, global warming potential (GWP), and GHG intensity (GHGI). The experiments were conducted during the 2020 dry season in Central Java province, Indonesia, evaluating continuous flooding (CF) and AWD as the main plot, and biochar-compost (BC) mixture at a rate of 0, 5, and 10 t ha−1as the sub-plot. The results unveiled that AWD on silty clay and silt loam soil reduced water use by 12% and 18%, respectively. The implementation of AWD on silt loam soil significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the total GWP by 39.6% without yield loss and GHGI by 38.4% compared to CF. Conversely, on silty clay soil, the GWP and GHGI reduction was marginal (only about 4%). Biochar-compost addition was significantly reduced water use in both soil textures. We found that the implementation of AWD on coarse texture is more efficient in reducing water use and GWP. Expanding studies on several rice growing season on multiple location can reduce the limitation of our study and further assist in environmental decision making for the rice system in terms of GHG mitigation action and saving irrigation water. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Due to its increasing demands for fossil fuels, Indonesia needs an alternative energy to diversify its energy supply. Landfill gas (LFG), which key component is methane (CH4), has become one of the most attractive options to sustain its continued economic development. This exploratory study seeks to demonstrate the added value of landfilled municipal solid waste (MSW) in generating sustainable energy, resulting from CH4 emissions in the Bantargebang landfill (Jakarta). The power generation capacity of a waste-to-energy (WTE) plant based on a mathematical modeling was investigated. This article critically evaluated the production of electricity and potential income from its sale in the market. The project's environmental impact assessment and its socio-economic and environmental benefits in terms of quantitative and qualitative aspects were discussed. It was found that the emitted CH4 from the landfill could be reduced by 25,000 Mt annually, while its electricity generation could reach one million kW ⋅h annually, savings on equivalent electricity charge worth US$ 112 million/year (based on US' 8/kW ⋅ h). An equivalent CO2 mitigation of 3.4 × 106 Mt/year was obtained. The income from its power sale were US$ 1.2 ×106 in the 1st year and 7.7 ×107US$ in the 15th year, respectively, based on the projected CH4 and power generation. The modeling study on the Bantargebang landfill using the LFG extraction data indicated that the LFG production ranged from 0.05 to 0.40 m3 per kg of the landfilled MSW. The LFG could generate electricity as low as US' 8 per kW ⋅ h. With respect to the implications of this study, the revenue not only defrays the cost of landfill's operations and maintenance (O&M), but also provides an incentive and means to further improve its design and operations. Overall, this work not only leads to a diversification of primary energy, but also improves environmental protection and the living standard of the people surrounding the plant. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Mangrove forests are known to provide great benefits to the community as an ecosystem service and globally. Mangrove forests are threatened with loss due to anthropogenic and non-anthropogenic activities. Our previous research results show the important role of mangroves in the context of climate change for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and the diversity of terpenoids for salinity defense. The term metabarcoding of environmental DNA as a key indicator for evaluating mangrove ecosystems was introduced. This work proposed framework to study environmental DNA metabarcoding applications that can provide accurate information for evaluating mangrove ecosystems using an easy and fast method. The rich mangrove forest is getting disappeared without being recognized by its true diversity, function, and potential services to human beings. Application of conservation activities based on the species diversity in the mangrove ecosystem is almost impossible, because it is too difficult to study, in term of time and effort, despite the importance of acquiring the biodiversity information. However, DNA metabarcoding can be a "dream-like"tool and will contribute to obtain the species diversity data of the mangrove ecosystem, rapidly, globally, and massively.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Most power plants, particularly those that burn fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and gas, create CO2, a greenhouse gas that contributes to climate change. By 2060, the Indonesian government has committed to reach net zero emissions. With the lowest CO2 emissions, nuclear power plants are dependable sources of energy. Small modular reactors (SMRs) are a particular kind of nuclear power plant that has the potential to be Indonesia’s first commercial nuclear power plant because of their small size, low capacity, uncomplicated design, and modular characteristics. The purpose of this study is to examine the economics and technological feasibility of SMRs. In this analysis, the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) comparative method and the technology readiness level (TRL) approach are both applied. The SMRs with a minimum TRL value of 7 were CAREM-25 (TRL7), KLT-40S (TRL8), and HTR-PM (TRL 8), according to the results of this research. Although CAREM-25 and KLT-40S are still in the demonstration stage and have not yet entered the market, their LCOE estimates are greater than 0.07 USD/kWh with a 5% discount rate. Whereas CAREM 100 MW is an economy scale from CAREM-25 and VBER 300 MW is a commercial size from KLT-40S, HTR-PM is already an economy scale. With discount rates between 5% and 10%, the LCOE values of HTR-PM, CAREM 100 MW, and VBER 300 MW range from 0.06 USD to 0.12 USD per kWh. Other than hydropower and coal-fired power plants, these LCOE figures can compete with the local LCOE in Indonesia and the LCOE of a variety of other types of power plants. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Global dependence on fossil fuels remains high despite the rapid expansion of renewable energy initiatives, and fossil fuels extracted from the earth’s crust are major contributors to greenhouse gasses. Unlike greenhouse gas studies in the downstream area, currently, few studies have investigated greenhouse gas in the upstream field, and there is no published study related to carbon emission influencing factors in Indonesia’s upstream field. A short panel data analysis is used to investigate the influence of oil and gas production and energy usage on greenhouse gas emissions by using data from 25 upstream fields (including offshore and onshore fields) collected from 2015 to 2018. The results show that maintaining a constant energy usage leads to increased oil and gas production and reduced greenhouse gas emissions. This pattern implicitly indicates that improving energy efficiency during oil and gas production is critical for ensuring production stability and further reducing greenhouse gas. This study may contribute significantly toward the industrial decar-bonization approach that includes upstream processes to achieve net-zero carbon emissions. We recommend further research to study the carbon mitigation pattern in the upstream petroleum fields. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Indonesian electric vehicle (EV) market has undergone insignificant development as the EV adoption level remains low. Acceleration of EV adoption through better policies and regulations is critical to help to achieve the Indonesian government's commitment to reduce the greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions by 29% in 2030. Understanding the EV market and its structural barriers that dampen the policies bring promising outcomes for delivering the intended results of emission reduction. Moreover, the multi-actor perspectives and interests within the EV market also highlight a dynamic and complex nature, characterizing the system observed. By taking a systems view, this paper aims to analyze the market structure and challenges for government policies to promote EV adoption and explore how these strategies would affect Indonesia's sustainable development using a conceptual approach of system dynamics modeling. The model forms six reinforcing and three balancing loops categorized into five essential aspects in EV adoption: vehicle repurchasing, technology shifting, infrastructure development, and commercial-induced buying for both first-time and repurchased consumers. This result shows that pricing, infrastructure development, and perceived social utility are the most determining factors for increasing willingness to adopt EV. Innovation and education aspects also emphasize a specific role in catalyzing a higher adoption rate.  © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {The transportation sector is one of the largest fuel consumers and pollutant contributors worldwide. The International Maritime Organization predicts that the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from transportation will be increasing significantly until 2050, driven by the growth in global maritime trade. Managing logistics distribution routes is considered a possible approach for controlling GHG emissions. This study aims to implement a green logistics concept in the logistics distribution of petroleum products—gasoline, kerosene, and diesel—in eastern Indonesia, whose supply sources are refineries located in Balikpapan and Kasim. A multi-objective approach is used to implement the green logistics concept. Multi-objective optimization is conducted using the AIMMS software to optimize a logistics system consisting of a multi-depot, multi-product, and heterogeneous fleet. The optimization is performed to determine the best logistics route and the amount of products delivered using certain types of fleets to minimize transportation cost and GHG emissions using constant speed. In addition, this study also investigates the effect of variable speed on cost and CO2 emissions. For the constant speed case, the distribution routes obtained for the minimizing cost scenario tends to maximize the utilization of transit terminals while in the minimizing emissions scenario tends to deliver directly to the distribution centers, so the route decision in multi-objective optimization scenario is combination of the two. The multi-objective optimization results an 11% cost reduction and a 17% GHG emission reduction compared with the current values. The comparison between constant and variable speed reveals that the variable speed is preferred to constant speed as it gives lower emissions with slight changes in cost. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Water management is a key factor in the development of swampland for agriculture, especially rice. Naturally, swampland is affected by water tide from the sea or river during spring and neap tide. Micro water management greatly influences the success of farming in swampland. The functions of micro water management: improvement of land quality, leaching out of ions and toxic compounds, controlling of certain weeds and pests, plant growth and yield, and mitigating of climate change and greenhouse gas emissions. There are many factors influence the increasing rice production in swampland through improved water management. For example, the implementation of a one-way water flow system or a dam overflow system is restricted by tide strength, canal dimensions, and construction and operational of water gate. Support of water supply network infrastructure is important and influences land productivity and cropping intensity. In poor swamp irrigation areas (SIA), most farmers can only plant once a year (Cropping Index, CI=100) with productivity 2-3 t ha-1. But in a good SIA, the yield reaches 6-7 t ha-1 and 2-3 planting times a year (CI 180-200). The implementation of water management in agriculture in swampland also requires the participation of farmers and solid institutional of water administrator. This paper is a review of several research results on the implementation of water management in tidal swampland that have been carried out by Indonesian Swampland Agricultural Research Institute (ISARI). This paper will address the constraints, limitations and opportunities of water management including an effort to mitigate and adapt to climate change through water management in tidal swampland of Kalimantan, Indonesia.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {There has been an increasing concern in the development of sustainability in Indonesia. Indonesia's sustainability policy through Indonesian Palm Oil Sustainability (ISPO) and recently Presidential Decree Number 44 of 2020 on Certification System for Sustainable Palm Oil Plantations prove the government's seriousness in managing palm oil. Growing global market demand requires the expansion of oil palm plantations. Unfortunately, land expansion can cause environmental hazards, such as deforestation, loss of biodiversity, increased greenhouse gas emissions, and green land damage. On the other hand, the threat to sustainable development in the palm oil industry and pressure from stakeholders for more responsible industrial practices require sustainable production activities and minimize environmental and social impacts through sustainability principles. The government, companies, smallholders, palm oil associations, and INGO/NGO strive to build synergies in finding strategic solutions under the ISPO certification scheme. This article explores the involved actors in the palm oil industry and the relationship pattern between actors. Methodologically, the author uses a qualitative method and multi-stakeholder approach to invent how actors deal with sustainability issues in the palm oil industry and carry out sustainability commitments. The results show that Indonesia faces economic, social, and environmental imbalance. In implementing ISPO certification, Indonesia has involved all multi-stakeholder actors: state, company, IGO, and civil society. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The large amount of plastic waste that can not be decomposed and eventually carried away into the sea is estimated to cause more plastic than fish in the ocean in 2050. Indonesia is the second-largest country in the production of marine plastic debris in the world after China. It occurs because of a misleading in waste management while still on land. Plastic debris in the marine will adversely affect the ecosystem in the sea and also the coastal. The reduction of marine debris will not run optimally if it is not supported by active involvement from the government, producers, and the community. This research was normative research based on primary and secondary legal materials. This study aimed to review the implementation of policies based on action plans to reduce marine debris. The result showed that with the baseline marine debris policy at 0.49-0.86 million tonnes/year, it required acceleration efforts from the government, producers, and the community to reduce marine debris by 70% by 2025.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Tropical savanna forests are one of the forest ecosystems found in the Indonesian region with a semi-arid climate type prone to drought and fire. Forest fires contribute to the release of greenhouse gas emissions into the atmosphere. The calculation method to estimate the burnt area is still an obstacle in calculating greenhouse gas emissions due to forest fires. This research aims to assess the burnt area in tropical savanna forest cover type using medium resolution satellite imagery data by utilizing the Normalized Burn Ratio index in four villages in East Sumba Regency and estimating greenhouse gas emissions these activities. The results showed that the NBR method does not produce an estimate of the burned area with a fair degree of accuracy because the characteristic of channel 7 (SWIR) is sensitive to vegetation moisture content. The savanna forest cover type is the type of land cover identified as the most dominant burned area. It produces the highest greenhouse gas emissions compared to other land cover types. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {High yield and low methane emission are two goals in tidal swampland management systems. In tidal swampland, draining converts soil organic matter to be oxidized and release emission of CO2 into the atmosphere. Organic matter has been used as a soil amendment to improve the properties of this soil. Methane is produced by anaerobic soil bacteria, methanogens, and methanotrophs, by utilizing organic matter from the soil and rice root exudates, and it is transported to the atmosphere through aerenchyma. In wetland soil, rice straw incorporation with and existing vegetation are a source of organic matter to improve soil fertility. However, management of organic matter with a traditional system called "Tajak, Puntal, Ampar"often increase methane (CH4) emissions, one of the main sources of anthropogenic CH4. A portion of organic matter decomposition in saturated soils yielding methane (CH4) rather than CO2. Methane is one of the main greenhouse gases and is known to be a major cause of global warming. We analyze each of the components of technology and its relation to lessons learned. The environmentally friendly technology in tidal swampland includes: water management, land preparation and land management, amelioration and fertilization, use of low-emission varieties, and intercropping. Implementation of this technology in swamps can reduce greenhouse gas emissions. This paper presents a framework for environmentally friendly farming in the wetland for food production, which includes (1) the characterization and problem of soil; and (2) environmentally friendly technology.

	abstract = {Global warming and climate change are some of the greatest socio-scientific issues in recent decades. Many factors contribute to these issues, the footprint of human activities as well as natural phenomena. Human energy consumption in many sectors i.e food supply, livestock, industry, and transportation significantly increasing earth surface temperature average level and climate change. Various studies were carry out about global warming and climate change interdisciplinary. Integration of these socio-scientific issues into science learning as an effort to educate and enhance student environmental awareness and scientific literacy is necessary to do. Rational of this article is to studies global warming and climate change topics from integrative science context; biology (microbial activities, ruminants, and environmental impacts), chemistry (the various chemical reaction that causes greenhouse gases and global warming), and physics (temperature, heat, and global climate). This study is urgent because microbial activities that contribute into greenhouse gases releasing in ruminant enteric fermentation process haven't included and connected yet in Indonesia's science learning. Ruminant should be highlighted in these issues because Indonesia is an agricultural country which has enormous farmhouse area. In addition, students are expected to be able to solve problems and make the right decisions related to these issues. This article will discuss suggestion global warming and climate change topics in terms of microbial activities, ruminant and mitigation strategies to reduce GHG from livestock sector. This suggestion is expected to meet the Sustainable development goals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Mangroves are unique intertidal ecosystems that are experiencing high rates of deforestation throughout the world. Indonesia that has the highest mangrove cover in the world has lost its mangroves significantly in 1980s with the expansion of aquaculture development due to the increased shrimp price during the Asian economic crisis. Mangrove loss emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere that contributes to the global warming. This study aims to estimate the extent of mangrove deforestation in Indonesia and the potential greenhouse gas emissions generated from mangrove deforestation in the last decade. We analyzed the land cover maps produced by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry from 2009 to 2019 to calculate mangrove deforested areas as activity data. The average emission factor from mangrove deforestation is 136.9 MgCO2e ha-1yr-1, based on a meta-analysis from mangrove studies in Indonesia. Our result shows the total mangrove loss in the period of 2009 - 2019 covers an estimated area of 182,091 ha. The spatial analysis suggests that the main drivers of mangrove deforestation were derived from conversion of mangroves to low vegetated areas, aquaculture and agriculture practices. Mangrove deforestation potentially generates a significant amount of 182.6 MtonCO2e to the atmosphere within 10 years. If mangrove loss continues, a significant amount of greenhouse gases will be accumulated in the atmosphere and negatively affect their unique biodiversity. Halting mangrove deforestation and conserving the remaining mangrove forests is the most cost effective and efficient measure to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

However, GHG emissions of lithium ion battery (LiB) production for a vehicle with recycling during its life cycle have not been clarified. Moreover, demands for nickel (Ni), cobalt, lithium, and manganese, which are materials for batteries, are increasing, but they are located in relatively dry areas, and mining is a water-intensive activity. Thus, the environmental impact of water use in mining areas has been raised as an issue, but many unknowns remain. We estimated the demand and scrapped amount for these metals for vehicle LiB until 2030 in Japan to clarify the internal structure of the life cycle impact. We also evaluated the cradle-to-gate GHG emissions from the batteries and the water consumption in Japan’s supplier countries for these metals and their potential of reduction rate with or without pyrometallurgical or hydrometallurgical recycling. We found that GHG emissions can be reduced by only 4.5%, whereas water consumption can be reduced by as much as 13% among Ni-supplying countries, such as Indonesia, with recycling under the closed-loop cycle. © 2021, Springer Japan KK, part of Springer Nature.},

In this study, a field experiment was conducted to determine CH4 emissions from various high-yielding inbred varieties and the relationship between CH4 emissions and rice growth parameters. The field experiment was conducted in Jaken, Pati Regency, Central Java province, during the wet season of 2014/2015. The experiment was arranged using a randomized block design with three replications and several cultivar treatments (Inpari 13, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 29, 30, 31, 32, and 33, with Ciherang as the comparison cultivar). The data collected includes CH4 flux, plant height, tiller number, biomass, grain yield, and root aerenchyma area. The CH4 flux was measured at several critical growth stages. The Inpari 24, Inpari 13, and Inpari 19 demonstrated CH4 emissions reduced by as much as 36.1%, 32.8%, and 21.3%, respectively, compared to Ciherang. The Inpari 13 and Inpari 24 varieties had significantly lower emission indices than Ciherang and the other Inpari varieties, with 17 and 20 g CH4 per 1 kg grain yield, respectively.

The present study aims to understand how such capacities are developed at the organizational level and how this process is influenced by changes in the institutional environments. To this end, we selected the case of Indonesia, a country where the task of producing a national GHG inventory was once outsourced to experts but is now managed within the Ministry of Environment and Forestry. This paper probes why and how this is possible through two different lenses: a model of strategic issue diagnosis and the framework for implementation analysis. Based on data obtained through participant observation, interviews, and document reviews, both approaches were vital in studying the importance of clarity and consistency of basic policy decisions. This study also highlighted the role of capacity development and found that these factors interacted with each other to create positive impacts on the implementation of a national GHG inventory in Indonesia. The analytical frameworks we used can be applied to contexts in other countries. While the model of strategic issue diagnosis enables us to check each aspect of issue interpretations by decision-makers and other organizational participants (urgency, feasibility, and interdependence), the framework for implementation analysis assists with determining if the necessary conditions exist for effective policy implementation. These results are useful for governments and/or donor agencies to identify priority areas of intervention. © 2020, AESS.},

	abstract = {In the fight against climate change, the utilization of renewable energy resources is being encouraged in every country all over the world to lessen the emissions of greenhouse gases. However, not all countries are able to efficiently utilize these resources, and instead of providing solutions, the inefficient use of renewable energy may lead to even more damage to the environment. Data from eight countries belonging to the highly industrialized countries (HIC) group and nine from newly industrialized countries (NIC) group were used to evaluate the energy utilization of these groups. Factors such as total renewable energy capacity, the labor force, and total energy consumption were considered to be the input factors, while, CO2 emission and gross domestic product are the output factors. These factors were used to calculate efficiency scores of every country from 2013 to 2018 using the undesirable output model of Data envelopment analysis (DEA). The grey prediction model was also used to measure the forecasted values of the input and output factors for the year 2019 to 2022, and measure again the future efficiency scores of the HICs and NICs. The combination of grey prediction and DEA undesirable output model made this paper unusual and the most appropriate method in dealing with data that contains both desired and undesired outputs. The results show that the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the United States continuously top the efficiency ranking among the HIC group, with a perfect 1.0 efficiency score from 2013 to 2022. Russia demonstrates the lowest score of 0.1801 and is expected to perform the same low-efficiency score in the future. Within the NIC group, Indonesia can be highlighted for performing with perfect efficiency starting from the year 2015 and even through 2022. Other NICs are performing at a very low-efficiency, with scores ranging from 0.2278 to 0.2734 on average, with Turkey displaying the lowest rank. This study recommends some useful strategies to improve the utilization of renewable energy resources such as improvements in the political and legal structure surrounding their use and regulation, tax incentives or exemptions to private power producers to encourage shifting away from conventional energy production, partnerships with non-governmental and international organizations that can provide assistance in managing renewable energies, strengthening of the energy sector's research and development activities and long-term strategic plans for the development in renewable energy with considerations to the social, environmental, and economic impact on each country. © 2020 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Peatlands play an important role as carbon pools, storing a third of the world's soil carbon. However, peatlands in Southeast Asia have suffered from depletion due to economic pressure and the demand for natural resources, often caused by land use changes and fires. Usually, land preparation requires drainage and fires, resulting in major greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions into the atmosphere. In this work, we propose a general equation to estimate GHG emissions from fires on peatlands. The contribution of each parameter to the variance of the estimated GHG emissions was also evaluated. We used Monte Carlo simulation, meta-analyses, and an analytical expression of variance. GHG emissions of a single fire episode were estimated at 842 Mg ha−1 CO2 eq. with a standard deviation of 466 Mg ha−1 CO2 eq. The parameter contributing most to variance was the depth of burn, at 94.2%, followed by bulk density, at 5.5%, and emission factors, at 0.3%. Our estimated GHG emissions were close to the amount estimated from the default values provided by the IPCC, strengthening confidence in the IPCC methodology. When the depth of burn was assessed by remote sensing, the parameter that most contributed to variance became the fire-damaged area, followed by the depth of burn. The contribution of each parameter to variance, as estimated in this study, made it possible to prioritize the effort in uncertainty reduction. Combining Monte Carlo simulation and an analytical expression of variance could be a promising way of obtaining more reliable confidence intervals. © 2020. American Geophysical Union.

Biomass is an organic matter to which derived from biological materials. This research was used integration gasification system with a gas engine, which works more properly with CO, and H2. The advantage of this biomass power plant compared the environmental impact on other types of plants such as coal-fired power plants, diesel power plants, etc. Therefore the potential of environmental impacts was generated, it is necessary to calculate quantitatively through the life cycle assessment methods. This research aimed to calculate impact assessment on electricity production from a Biomass Power Plant system through a life cycle assessment with boundary cradle to grave in Indonesia. The study revealed that greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of electricity production from an empty fruit bunch palm oil mill was 0.15 kg CO2-eq kWh-1. The gas engine was the highest GHG emission contributor during its life cycle. Empty fruit bunch as a source of biomass for electricity production was considered as climate-friendly power plant system due to its potential in reducing GHG emission from palm oil production and released lower GHG emission.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

	abstract = {Peatlands in Indonesia have been objected to draining, burning and converting into agriculture lands causing huge greenhouse gas emissions and triggering climate change. To reduce emissions on peatland but still keep maintaining community livelihoods, farmers need to be trained with best practices on peatland uses and management. Under the Haze Free Sustainable Livelihoods Project, three trainings have been conducted, namely training on nursery and land preparation without burning, training on post harvests processing of fish and corn, and training on honeybee cultivation. The training participants are community who live in and around the Peatland Hydrological Unit of Kampar-Indragiri Rivers, Riau. An impact assessment of the completed trainings has been conducted which employe four-level evaluation model as proposed by Kirkpatrick (1994). The results indicatesthat all of the trainings improve participants' knowledge and skill. Moreover, the honeybee cultivation training has also transformed participants' behaviour to be more preserve and maintain nectarpollen and resin producing trees, pollen and sap. The trainings, however, are yet to affect household income although an increase of profit has been recorded on some champion participants. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of utilizing lignite coal in Indonesia is to decrease fuel costs in electricity and Greenhouse Gas emissions. Still, on the other hand, it will affect the reliability and plant performance. This paper attempts to evaluate 340 MW subcritical coal-fired power plant's performance and reliability by comparing the impact of coal utilization below boiler design toward the baseline and identifying the significant factors that lead to plant efficiency and reliability. Performance tests conducted using the standard procedures at four segments of load, i.e., 50%, 65%, 80%, and 95%, with two scenarios: (1) use 3500 kcal/kg of coal calorific value, and (2) use 4500 kcal/kg of coal as the baseline. There are no adjustments during the test and all measurements, including pressure, temperature, flow, bomb calorimeter, etc., already calibrated. The results show that during 3500 kcal/kWh, 100% of the load is unable to reach. Plant performance becomes higher up to 2930 kcal/kWh, boiler efficiency decrease to 80.4%, and fans current increase to maximum capacity. The study's conclusion suggests that the utilization of LRC must be considering the energy amount to the boiler.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesia, like many countries, has committed to reducing its greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. To do this, the country needs to move from its current high reliance on non-renewable energy sources to renewable sources of energy. The issue is significant for Indonesia as the country is the 4th largest contributor to global CO2 emissions. The country has abundant sources for energy and one of these sources is the potential for solar energy. Therefore, the country has set ambitious renewable energy targets based on the potential supply of solar energy. With domestic residential consuming up to 43% of total electricity consumption, the Government has targeted homeowners to install solar rooftop and become residential solar PV prosumers. However, a recent energy evaluation report indicates that the country’s progress is very slow and it is highly likely that renewable energy goals will not be achieved. This study conducted an online survey of a small sample of regular electricity subscribers and residents who have installed solar rooftop in the hope of gaining a better understanding of various issues and factors which could be impeding the growth of residential solar. Some of areas the study explored included the level of knowledge and awareness of solar energy, initiatives for homeowners, policy on net-metering and feed-in tariff, and areas of concern related to economic, environmental, and technological factors. While many countries are struggling to shift to greener energy generation and consumption, in Indonesia’s case, the country has its own unique set of challenges being the energy generation and distribution is centralised, state-owned, with an inflexible energy pricing system. Hence, energy management in Indonesia could benefit from becoming more market focused and transparent, while increasing technology adoption with hybrid community partnerships, including a mix of private and government ownership. A discussion on policy implications and suggestions for improvements can be found at the end of this paper. © 2021, Aalborg University press. All rights reserved.},

This study aimed to estimate the energy balances and determine the environmental impact of Robusta and Arabica coffee production as well as identify the measures to increase the efficiency of Robusta and Arabica yield using the life cycle assessment (LCA) method. The potential adverse impacts of processing ground coffee manifest themselves in the forms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, acidification, as well as water and environmental pollution due to solid and liquid waste disposal. The total GHG emissions for Arabica coffee processing is 1,804 t CO2-eq year-1 while for Robusta, it is 1,356 t CO2-eq year-1. The total acidification potential for Arabica coffee processing can be given by 8,013 kg NO2-eq year-1 and 10,663 kg SO2-eq year-1, while for Robusta coffee processing, the potential for acidification is represented by 60.97 kg NO2-eq year-1 and 79.58 kg SO2-eq year-1, and the potential GHG per unit weight of Arabica and Robusta ground coffee processing were 98.7 CO2-eq kg-1 and Robusta 119.6 CO2-eq kg-1, respectively. The potential measures to mitigate this include replacing gasoline with biofuel, utilising liquid waste with chemical processing, and solid wastes of coffee production, such as brickquetess and bio-pellets for renewable energy. © 2021,Journal of Ecological Engineering.All Rights Reserved.},

The inventory has measured and disclosed a comprehensive GHG emissions inventory and to total these emissions using an approach that categorizes all emissions into scopes, depending on where they physically occur, i.e., Scope 1 for direct emissions and Scope 2 for indirect emissions. The GHG emission level of Scope 1 is estimated based on the IPCC 2006 (Tier-1/2), while Scope 2 employs national/local emissions factor that refers to the grid-connected emission factor of JAMALI. Based on the latest inventory in 2018, the GHG emissions profile of Jakarta is summarized as follows, i.e., the GHG emissions of Scope 1 is from direct fuels combustion in transport, industry, commercial and residential sectors (33.5%), fuels combustion in two power generations located in Jakarta (13.8%), and the remaining 3.8% is from waste treatment activity. The GHG emission of Scope 2 (48.8%) comes from the use of electricity (supplied by JAMALI-grid) generated outside the boundary of Jakarta. In addition, this study also shows estimates result of local pollutants that are affecting air quality. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Lowland rice cultivation is one of the main sources of methane emissions, accounting for around 5 to 19% of total global CH4. One of the efforts to reduce CH4 gas emissions that is environmentally friendly is through methane-utilizing bacteria. This study aimed to determine the effect of methane-utilizing bacteria on rice yield and methane emissions. The bacterial strains used were Mycobacterium senegalense LM1, Providencia stuartii LM18, Rhizobium rhizoryzae BMU, and Bacillus methylotrophicus N2P4. The research was conducted in the experimental field of The Indonesian Center for Rice Research, Bogor, Indonesia. The experiment was carried out by using a factorial randomized block design with two factors and three replications. The first factor was the dose of NPK inorganic fertilizer (50%, 75%, 100%). The second factor was bacterial consortium formulas (without bacteria, bacterial consortium 1, bacterial consortium 2). The application of a bacterial consortium containing all strains increased the efficiency of inorganic fertilizers by 25%, increased rice production by 33.55%, and reduced CH4 emissions by 37.26%. It seems that the consortium of methane-utilizing bacteria has the prospect of biofertilizer and mitigation agents to mitigate the impact of global warming. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Residential combustion in Southeast Asia (SEA) releases large amounts of pollutants, including fine particles (PM2.5), black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC) and greenhouse gases (GHGs). This study quantified the annual emissions from lighting and cooking by the residential sector in SEA during 2010–2018 to create a new regional emissions inventory (EI). Available survey data of urban/rural fuel consumption and carefully scrutinized emission factors relevant for SEA typical fuel-cookstoves were used. The period average SEA emissions from the sector in Gg yr−1 were 734 ± 6 (PM2.5); 70 ± 3 (BC); 327 ± 3 (OC); 312,436 ± 5154 (CO2); 943 ± 11 (CH4) and 35.7 ± 0.5 (N2O). Lighting contributed from 0.1% of N2O to 16.5% of BC of the total sectoral emissions. Biomass fuels and biomass derived fuels, mainly charcoal, accounted for more than 85% of BC and nearly 100% of OC emissions from cooking alone. Over the period, SEA annual emissions of BC reduced by 11% owning to the declining use of kerosene (14.2%) while emissions of all other species increased. Charcoal consumption was also reduced (−3.7%) while consumption of other fuels increased, maximum for LPG by 6.8%. Average SEA emissions per capita (kg cap−1 yr−1) of PM2.5; BC; OC; CO2; CH4 and N2O from the sector were 1.19; 0.11; 0.53; 507; 1.46 and 0.06, respectively. Spatial distributions showed the highest BC emission intensities over Java island of Indonesia and over several populated areas in SEA. BC was the key contributor to the total global warming potential (GWP) of the emissions, i.e. sharing 86%, 57% and 30% of the total GWP over 20-, 100- and 500-yr time horizons if biomass fuels burning CO2 emissions were assumed to be climate neutral. Interventions to eliminate kerosene use would effectively reduce BC emissions and bring about greater co-benefits. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Land reclamation involves extracting fill from some areas (which in the tropics are commonly mangrove and seagrass ecosystems) and transporting and depositing it into zones being reclaimed as land for housing or industrial development. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are produced at various stages of the process (including for instance, from fuel used in dredging equipment). One substantial and site-dependent source of GHG emissions is associated with carbon stock losses resulting from the disturbance and extraction of fill from vegetated marine ecosystems. In this article we focus on these sources of GHG emissions and assess, for the first time, the potential carbon loss from mangrove ecosystems caused by land reclamation activities. To this end, we take a case study of a regionally significant, large-scale reclamation project in Jakarta Bay, Indonesia. The extent of mangroves likely to be impacted by the project was estimated by analysing land satellite (LANDSAT) imagery in the period before and after the start of reclamation activities. The carbon stored in the affected areas was then estimated using field measurements to determine total stocks (biomass and soil organic carbon). Mangroves in the study area at Serang (where sand mining is designated) and Angke (adjacent to deposition site) were estimated to store on average 203.64 Mg C ha−1, and 531.53 Mg C ha−1 respectively. The lower carbon stocks at Serang are a consequence of sand mining that occurred there in 2003. The regrown mangroves at Serang are smaller than that at Angke. The near-surface soil organic carbon (SOC) content at Serang was less than at Angke, 17% and 43% of the total respectively. Results also reveal that around 75% of total carbon stocks in both sites are in the form of SOC. We suggest that collating this sort of information about carbon stocks in sites impacted by land reclamation activities can help development planners identify opportunities to reduce GHG emissions. To illustrate, long-term carbon losses due to land reclamation in the case study area could be reduced if dredging is limited to 1 m depth and mangrove areas are actively rehabilitated. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {An increase of CO2 emission on the atmosphere appears to be one of the most significant environmental threats for all living things, the ecosystem, and even the global economy. Household consumption patterns are proven to have contributed 60-70% to global emissions. Hence, we aim to analyze the impact of Indonesia's household environmental load for the transition towards low-carbon living to reduce GHG emissions that cause climate change. This study aims to investigate the relationship between several household expenditure categories to CO2 emission, using Indonesian Family Life Survey (IFLS) data as the only large-scale longitudinal survey available in Indonesia, which means showing carbon footprint at the level of Indonesia household consumption practices. Generally, the results show that energy for houses (electricity and kerosene), and household electrical appliances are the top three carbon footprint generators. Based on the results, the total emission in urban areas is way higher than in rural areas. Correlation analysis indicates that both of factors, number of household members and total income did not significantly affects (low correlation) total emission in the urban areas (r < 0.5), while total income impacts the rural regions (r = 0.88) in 1993. These findings are important to generate solutions based on segmented targets towards a net-carbon society.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {*To reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emission as a commitment of Indonesia in the Paris Agreement 2015, Indonesia government is enhancing using of green and sustainable energy replacing fossil energy resources. One of government's actual commitments is written in Government Regulatory no. 55/2019 regarding the acceleration programs of battery-based Electric Vehicles (EVs) which is believed to emit low emissions to the atmosphere. This study promotes an extended version of the Theory of Planned Behavior to analyze the impacts of personal beliefs on individual adoption intention towards EVs and structural equation modeling (SEM) method to quantify its acceptance level in Indonesia. The limitations of this research are a) study analyzes Indonesian acceptance level towards Plug-in Hybrid (PHEV) and Full Battery (BEV) based Electric Car; b) study was conducted in the situation of the pandemic of Covid-19 that might influence psychology of respondents. A questionnaire survey was conducted online from December 2020 to February 2021 to Indonesian people. A total of 154 valid survey responses were obtained. Based on the empirical results, we concluded that environmental concern (ENC) has a significant positive effect on adoption intention (AdIn) on EVs purchasing only with perceived behavior control (PBC).as mediator. In Indonesia, PBC factor influences AdIn factor which is relatively high (path coefficient=0.739). This result is indicating penetration of EVs in Indonesia can be done by prioritizing PBC factors, such as performance attributes/ ease of use (battery lifespan, charging time, maintenance, charging infrastructure availability, etc.) and usefulness (free from odd-even rule, privilege right of using bus lane, and other non-monetary incentives). Other variables such as attitude (ATT), subjective norm (SUN), and personal moral norm (PMN) have no significant effect on EVs adoption intention (AdIn). Since there are limitations of this study, so we suggest that future study can be done in normal condition (recovered from pandemic condition) and extends study to electric two-wheelers market. Additionally, future study should consider increasing portion of questionnaire respondents who have driving or taking on EVs so that study can get more accurate data analysis. Study is expected to help government to engineer intervention policies and guide automotive industries to invest in more accurate market planning. Study is also expected to support other studies in simulation (e.g., forecasting) in future. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is among the top 10 highest countries in the world producing huge amount of greenhouse gases (GHG) to the atmosphere. However, climate change including its impacts might not be understandable by public in Indonesia. This is because climate change is not a crucial issue in this developing country. Education can play important roles in supporting national policies in reducing GHG in Indonesia by communicating climate change and in raising environmental awareness among people including students in schools. This study aims to determine high school students' perceptions about climate change, to provide insights for curriculum planning to combat climate change. Furthermore, this study can also provide some strategies to the government changes by improving formal education in combating climate change. This study is conducted in the 6 selected high schools in Samboja district, Kutai Kartanegara regency, East Kalimantan province, Indonesia. Data collection was conducted from February to March 2017. Primary data is collected by using questionnaires, which are distributed to the 1st, 2nd and 3rd grade students in each selected high schools. In total there are 360 students participating in this study. Results shows that majority of students in this study have heard about climate change, however their answer are inconsistent. This indicates that these students do not fully understand about climate change. Furthermore, students also do not know about the main causes of climate change. In conclusion, climate change issues need to be elaborated in science curriculum. It is suggested that the government should introduce policies in education sectors to inform about climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions are liable in climate change policies in many countries around the world. However, there are still many impact assessment studies in different regions that consider only CO2 emissions. We hypothesise that excluding non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions, which are also liable in climate change policies, may lead to misleading results and impacts. We employ a global climate change policy model (GTAP-E-PowerS) to examine how the impact of a uniform carbon tax at US$15 applying to the world regions are different when only CO2 emissions are liable compared to the case that non-CO2 emissions are additionally subject to the tax. That is, the impacts of the carbon tax applying to CO2 emissions only (against no carbon tax) will be compared to the impacts of such a tax applying to both CO2 and non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions (against no carbon tax). Results show the deviations in the impacts between with and without inclusion of non-CO2 emissions are more obvious in developing countries particularly by comparison to developed nations. Iran, for instance, experiences a higher reduction in real GDP of 1.52 percentage points when non-CO2 emissions are overlooked. These impact deviations also rise with increased costs to economies (e.g., more sectors involved or higher tax rates). We find developing countries experience higher contraction rates in their economies than developed nations. Iran, Kazakhstan, South Africa, China, India, Russia, Mexico, and Indonesia all experience 2–5.1% reductions in real GDP relative to business-as-usual (no carbon tax), while such reductions are below 0.8% in Australia, the United States and other developed nations because emission costs compared to economy size are relatively high in developing nations. Major polluting countries like China, the United States, India, and Russia were also found to have low marginal abatement costs compared to other nations due to high emission levels and input substitution possibilities. To provide more accurate and insightful impacts of climate change policies, we recommend future studies include both CO2 and non-CO2 emissions in models. © 2021},

	abstract = {Indonesia is facing serious problem with huge amount of Municipal solid waste (MSW), whilst landfilling still the main option to dealing with it. The landfilling of the MSW is associate to the environmental issue, especially due to the leachate and landfill gas emissions. The leachate produces which is containing hazardous materials, while the landfill gas which mainly containing CO2 and CH4 that categorized as greenhouse gases. The leachate and landfill gas emissions were influenced by many factors, including climatic condition. This research was aimed to determine the effect of leachate recirculation on leachate production and landfill gas emissions of MSW landfill in tropical climate region. The experiment was carried out by using 2 landfill simulator reactors (LSRs) made of high density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe with 50 cm OD and 150 cm length. The sample used was collected from the Blang Bintang landfill, a regional landfill constructed to accept MSW from Banda Aceh municipality and Aceh Besar District. The LSRs were operated under difference operation mode, the first LSR were operate without leachate recirculation, however a certain amount of water was added to simulated the MSW landfill operated under conventional method. While the second LSR were operate with leachate recirculation to represent the MSW landfill operated under bioreactor landfill mode. Results of this study show the leachate recirculation has in significant affects on the rate of waste degradation and the landfill gas production. The highest CH4 concentration in landfill gas emission first and second LSRs were about 58% and 59%, respectively. This relatively small difference is probably due to the high rainfall in the tropics region. This results indicated that the potential of MSW landfill in tropical climate region as renewable energy, either operated under conventional or bioreactor landfills. © 2020 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

This research aims to assess CO2 absorption-related physiological characteristics of selected tropical lowland trees that are curated in Cibinong Science Center-Botanical Garden (CSC-BG) Indonesia for revegetation prospecting. CO2 absorption, stomatal conductance, and transpiration were measured using an infrared gas analyzer photosynthesis system. Meanwhile, leaf chlorophyll content was estimated using a SPAD chlorophyll-meter. CO2 absorption rate ranged from 3.42 to 20 μmol m-2 s-1. The highest rate was observed in Teijsmanniodendron bogoriense followed by Tectona grandis (19.67 μmol m-2 s-1). The rate of transpiration ranged from 4.7 μmol m-2 s-1 to 7.82 μmol m-2 s-1. Diospyros discolor was the highest, followed by T. grandis (7.65 μmol m-2 s-1). CO2 absorption and rate of transpiration were positively correlated to stomatal conductance. In contrast, the CO2 absorption and chlorophyll content were very weakly correlated.

	abstract = {Extent and thickness of peat deposits in Indonesia are poorly constrained although both are important factors in regulating peat use and in planning peat conservation. Innovations for mapping the extent and thickness of peat deposits were developed and tested on two highly disturbed peat domes on the islands of Sumatra and Kalimantan (Borneo), Indonesia. Peat dome surface topography was mapped by transforming radar Digital Surface Models (DSM) to Digital Terrain Models (DTM) using ortho-photogrammetric techniques and cadastral standard Ground Control Points (GCPs). Soil core samples were collected along gradient transects to determine the peat base topography. A digital peat base model (DPBM) was generated by fitting a surface to the peat base elevation points in soil cores. Combining the peat surface DTM with the peat base DPBM provides a three-dimensional model of peat extent and thickness. Maps derived from these models can inform a ‘whole of dome’ approach to resolving competing land use goals, reducing regional smoke hazard and mitigating greenhouse gas emissions. The DPBM makes a critical contribution to accurate peat dome mapping and successful peat management on Indonesia’s coastal peatlands and in any other locations where peat has formed on an undulating irregular soil surface. © 2021, IMCG and IPS.

Short Communication: Investigating the environmental impacts of long-term monoculture of sugarcane farming in Indonesia through DPSIR framework. Biodiversitas 21: 4945-4958. An increasing trend of sugar demand in Indonesia due to the rising population has forced the government to boost its national sugarcane production through intensification program. Long-term monoculture system has long been practiced by sugarcane growers in Indonesia, particularly by large sugar companies for more than 30 years. This farming method bolsters the government’s program in scaling-up national sugar production. Through a literature study, the present study analyzed the impacts of long-term sugarcane monoculture in Indonesia on agroecosystem functions by using the Driver-Pressure-State-Impact-Response (DPSIR) framework. Results showed that long-term sugarcane monoculture leads to decreased soil quality, lowered hydrological functions, reduced agrobiodiversity, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Those conditions corresponded to reduced sugarcane yield and productivity, increased pests and diseases, decreased income gained by growers, higher dependencies on chemicals, and higher cultivation costs. In the end, we proposed several sustainable crop management to mitigate the detrimental effects of sugarcane monoculture practice in Indonesia. These include performing crop break or rotation with legume or the other cash crop, intercropping, green harvesting and trash blanket, precision agriculture methods, and soil amendment with organic matters. However, some constraints in implementing those sustainable crop management, such as inadequate knowledge and capital, should be considered. The information given in this study can be used by sugarcane growers or companies, policymakers, and sugarcane-related stakeholders as considerations to improve sugarcane productivity while at the same time minimizing its impact on the environment. © 2020, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

	abstract = {Global warming has become an important issue at this time, where this phenomenon is caused by an increase in the concentration of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs). Climate change is believed to have a negative impact on various aspects of life and the development sector, especially the agricultural sector, and it is feared that it will bring new problems to the sustainability of agricultural production, especially food crops. Rice fields are one the main anthropogenic source of nitrous oxide (N2O) gas, which contributes to global warming. Impact of climate change requires an active effort to anticipate it through mitigation and adaptation strategies. Therefore, the government of Indonesia has taken several steps to cope with anticipated greater losses, among others, through mitigation and adaptation programs. Mitigation measures in the agricultural sector is done through several activities, among others: the development of low-emission rice, ZA fertilizer use as nitrogen source, the development of rice cultivation technology without processing, the development of organic agriculture, green energy development and the development of intermittent irrigation technology. While adaptation measures in this program include: adjustment of time and cropping patterns, use of resistant varieties of drought, submergence, and salinity; rain harvesting technology development, and irrigation technology. This paper attempt to highlight the position agricultural sector in climate change, either as an emitter, sink or impact prone sectors climate change.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The advantage of using biofuels as a renewable source is the significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. This study investigates the possibility of using biodiesel for gas turbine power plant in Indonesia through fuel testing analysis. Some biodiesel produced from four separated factories has been selected as samples for analyzing and then comparing to the fuel specification of three different gas turbine technologies located in Tello, Belawan and Gresik. It is found that no B20 biodiesel meet the requirements of fuel specification from all gas turbine technologies. This study recommends standardizing B20 biodiesel in Indonesia in order to be suitable with the fuel specification of gas turbines. In addition, some technical issues has been proposed to be further research. It is also recommended to do a pilot project using appropriate biodiesel at some gas turbines technologies on operation mode within life cycle cost analysis.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Increasing global demand of vegetable oils and biofuels results in significant oil palm expansion in southeastern Asia, predominately in Malaysia and Indonesia. The land conversion to oil palm plantations has posed risks to deforestation (50&thinsp;% of the oil palm was taken from forest during 1990-2005; Koh and Wilcove, 2008), loss of biodiversity and greenhouse gas emission over the past decades. Quantifying the consequences of oil palm expansion requires fine-scale and frequently updated datasets of land cover dynamics. Previous studies focused on total changes for a multi-year interval without identifying the exact time of conversion, causing uncertainty in the timing of carbon emission estimates from land cover change. Using Advanced Land Observing Satellite (ALOS) Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar (PALSAR), ALOS-2 PALSAR-2 and Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) datasets, we produced an annual oil palm area dataset (AOPD) at 100&thinsp;m resolution in Malaysia and Indonesia from 2001 to 2016. We first mapped the oil palm extent using PALSAR and PALSAR-2 data for 2007-2010 and 2015-2016 and then applied a disturbance and recovery algorithm (Breaks For Additive Season and Trend - BFAST) to detect land cover change time points using MODIS data during the years without PALSAR data (2011-2014 and 2001-2006). The new oil palm land cover maps are assessed to have an accuracy of 86.61&thinsp;% in the mapping step (2007-2010 and 2015-2016). During the intervening years when MODIS data are used, 75.74&thinsp;% of the detected change time matched the timing of actual conversion using Google Earth and Landsat images. The AOPD revealed spatiotemporal oil palm dynamics every year and shows that plantations expanded from 2.59 to 6.39<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">×106</span>&thinsp;ha and from 3.00 to 12.66<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">×106</span>&thinsp;ha in Malaysia and Indonesia, respectively (i.e. a net increase of 146.60&thinsp;% and 322.46&thinsp;%) between 2001 and 2016. The higher trends from our dataset are consistent with those from the national inventories, with limited annual average difference in Malaysia (0.2<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">×106</span>&thinsp;ha) and Indonesia (<span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">-0.17</span><span classCombining double low line"inline-formula">×106</span>&thinsp;ha). We highlight the capability of combining multiple-resolution radar and optical satellite datasets in annual plantation mapping to a large extent by using image classification and statistical boundary-based change detection to achieve long time series. The consistent characterization of oil palm dynamics can be further used in downstream applications.

	abstract = {The current study makes use of life cycle assessment to evaluate the potential greenhouse gas (GHG) savings in coal electricity generation by 5% co-firing with sorghum pellets. The research models the utilization of 100 thousand hectares of under-utilized marginal land in Flores (Indonesia) for biomass sorghum cultivation. Based on equivalent energy content, 1.12 tons of pellets can substitute one ton of coal. The calculated fossil energy ratio of the pellets was 5.8, indicating that the production of pellets for fuel is energetically feasible. Based on a biomass yield of 48 ton/ha·yr, 4.8 million tons of pellets can be produced annually. In comparison with a coal system, the combustion of only pellets to generate 8,300 GWh of electricity can reduce global warming impacts by 7.9 million tons of CO2-eq, which is equivalent to an 85% reduction in GHG emissions. However, these results changed when reduced biomass yield of 24 ton/ha·yr, biomass loss, field emissions, and incomplete combustion were considered in the model. A sensitivity analysis of the above factors showed that the potential GHG savings could decrease from the initially projected 85% to as low as 70%. Overall, the production of sorghum pellets in Flores and their utilization for electricity generation can significantly reduce the reliance on fossil fuels and contribute to climate change mitigation. Some limitations to these conclusions were also discussed herein. The results of this scenario study can assist the Indonesian government in exploring the potential utilization of marginal land for bioenergy development, both in Indonesia and beyond. © 2020 BRTeam.

Characterization of soil parameters included soil pH, organic matter (OM), zinc (Zn), and lead (Pb). The result showed soil pH value ranging from 6.07 to 6.85 which is slightly acid, organic matter ranged from 0.95% to 5.87%, while Zinc and lead concentration ranged from 49.2μg/g to 224.7μg/g and 4.3μg/g to 82.4 μg/g respectively and were below the permissible limits of heavy metals in soil recommended by World Health Organization (WHO). The mean concentration of both metals was detected low far from the landfill and higher close to the landfill, which proves that there had been the anthropogenic contribution of heavy metals pollution in the soil through the disposal of wastes.

	abstract = {The Government of the Republic of Indonesia states that the thermal energy for hot-mixed asphalt production shall be supplied by the direct combustion of fossil fuels in the form of diesel oil, natural gas, or fuel gas from coal gasification which may generate GHG emission. Biomasses are able to substitute the fossil fuels through gasification technology. Gasification converts the biomass using limited air into gaseous fuel containing mainly CO and H2 that are subsequently combusted to produce heat, carbon dioxide, and water. It is obvious that the CO2 is then absorbed by the plants for photosynthesis, maintaining a balanced closed cycle. This study examines the level of global warming potential of this system for supplying heat based on the openLCA v1.9 software. The analysis used a gate-to-gate approach to evaluate scenarios of shell gasification to produce 1 metric tonne of hot-mixed asphalt. The scope covers raw material supply and transportation, palm kernel shell gasification, and products. The evaluation concludes that gasification could potentially reduce CO2 emissions. Environmental impact analysis and interpretation of the results using the openLCA database of Traci 2.1 recommend that greater CO2 emission reduction is possible using palm kernel shell gasification, not only for supplying heat but also for electricity generation to operate all electrical equipments. © 2020, Zhejiang University Press.},

	abstract = {Land use change in the Bangsri sub-catchment of the Brantas basin in East Java during the past three decades has increased both local and global climate vulnerability, by degrading soils and contributing to net greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Our study aimed to estimate land use change and its impact on net carbon emissions, as well as to formulate strategies for adaptation to and mitigation of climate change downstream of a National park. We analyzed land cover changes from satellite imagery and measured carbon stocks in biomass, necromass and soil (0 to 30 cm) pools. Satellite imagery of land cover in 1994, 2001, 2011 and 2017 showed a decrease in natural forest area and an increase in the area of shrubs, agroforestry, production forests and annual crop land. Net CO2 emission increased from 2.4 to 6.4 Mg ha-1 year-1 in the periods 2001 to 2011 and 2011 to 2017, respectively. Sand mining is the most destructive land use pattern in the area, as it leaves soil profiles stripped of their topsoil. Vulnerability to less reliable rainfall has been addressed by the common creation of small reservoirs and the abundant use of irrigation for vegetables growing under partial shade in the agroforestry zone. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Small-scale anaerobic digestion of wet organic wastes can make positive contributions to climate mitigation, energy security and nutrient cycling in agri-food systems. However, the environmental sustainability of small-scale anaerobic digestion is undermined where lack of capacity to utilize the biogas fuel results in biomethane venting to the atmosphere, contributing to climate change. Policy support for improved manure management in Bali, Indonesia, has resulted in the installation of small (6 m3) anaerobic digesters across 752 Bali cattle breeding units. These 752 remote rural digesters annually vent approximately 75 482 ± 37 741 m3 of biomethane into the atmosphere as a waste, owing to lack of practical means to convert this potential fuel into useful energy. Meanwhile, most of these cattle farms lack access to electricity. This paper describes the performance of a novel, compact and versatile “BioMiniGen” system that provides convenient electricity generation from small-scale biogas production. This innovative system comprises: (i) a simple biogas desulfurizing system; (ii) a two-stroke, single cylinder (63 cc) air-cooled engine; (iii) an electric generator; (iv) an optional CO2 removal unit. Lifecycle assessment indicated that bioelectricity generated by the BioMiniGen would have a smaller environmental footprint than Indonesian grid electricity across 11 impact categories, including a negative global warming burden owing to avoidance of biogas venting. Trade-offs included a larger abiotic depletion burden associated with manufacture of the generators. Over a five-year lifetime, each unit, costing US$500, could generate up to 5971 kWh of electricity and mitigate up to 65.1 Mg CO2 eq., with a greenhouse gas abatement value up to US$13023. Across Bali, up to 898 ± 449 MWh yr−1 bioelectricity could be generated, and 1.92 ± 0.96 Gg CO2 eq. saved. Further pilot trials are needed to ascertain realistic biogas yields from cleaned digesters managed for bioenergy generation alongside manure management. BioMiniGen technology could make an important contribution to energy security for the 1.4 billion people globally who lack access to electricity. © 2020 The Author(s)},

By selecting three Southeast Asian countries as the cases, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand, the present study comparatively examined their institutional designs for producing the GHG inventories. They are common in terms that their national focal points make the overall coordination and other relevant line ministries provide activity data. A major difference exists regarding who is tasked to perform calculations of GHG inventories. By using the framework of Hood concerning the choice of whether to work through specific performance contracts or through direct employment, this study discussed that the variations between the countries may be associated with their differences in the following two factors: One is the number of potential service providers, as expressed by the number of GHG inventory experts as registered in the roster of the United Nations, and the other is the level of uncertainty about how the task is to be done, as measured by a share of the agriculture, forestry and other land use sector in the national GHG inventory. The development of the endogenous research base can contribute to the long-term improvement in GHG inventories. The finding has implications for assistance in building the transparency-related capacity. Development cooperation with developing countries may extend to identifying the categories that are crucial for their current GHG inventories and collaborating relevant research activities with national experts, including young researchers. © 2021 WITPress.

	abstract = {Industry development, climate change mitigation and renewable energy currently become the most essential challenge in tropical forest management, primarily in Indonesia. The existence of tropical forests is not only managed to maintain the stability of wood supply for commercial industries but also to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere and to generate energy alternatives from tree biomass. To answer this challenge, the development of fast-growing species like eucalyptus can become a good solution. However, the productivity of eucalyptus depends on its adaptability to the site condition. Therefore, understanding site-species interaction becomes the fundamental requirement before planted on a large scale. This study aimed to evaluate the initial performance of eucalyptus species developed in Jepara. An experiment consisted of three different eucalyptus species, i.e., E. alba, E. pellita, and E. urophylla, was established using a randomized complete block design. Sixteen parameters were selected to assess the eucalyptus performance, including survival, height, diameter, biomass accumulation (stem, branches, foliage, and total aboveground), crown length, crown radius, crown projection area, crown ratio, individual leaf area, individual leaf dry weight, specific leaf area, leaf mass area, and leaf area index. The comparison of the mean of tree attributes from each species was examined using ANOVA, followed by HSD Tukey. Results showed that all measured parameters indicated a significant difference among the three species (p<0.05), except for survival, foliage biomass, and crown ratio (p>0.05). The preliminary performance of E. pellita was relatively better than the other two species, mainly related to height (3.00±0.21 m), total aboveground biomass (49.86±3.60 kg ha-1), crown projection area (2.68±0.27 m2 ), and leaf area index (5.76±0.44). Our study concluded the initial performance of E. pellita in Jepara was substantially superior to E. alba and E. urophylla. Nevertheless, continuous evaluation is needed to monitor the consistent performance of those species in the study area. © 2021, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: nationally determined contributions (NDCs) serve to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement of staying “well below 2°C”, which could also yield substantial health co-benefits in the process. However, existing NDC commitments are inadequate to achieve this goal. Placing health as a key focus of the NDCs could present an opportunity to increase ambition and realise health co-benefits. We modelled scenarios to analyse the health co-benefits of NDCs for the year 2040 for nine representative countries (ie, Brazil, China, Germany, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, South Africa, the UK, and the USA) that were selected for their contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions and their global or regional influence. Methods: Modelling the energy, food and agriculture, and transport sectors, and mortality related to risk factors of air pollution, diet, and physical activity, we analysed the health co-benefits of existing NDCs and related policies (ie, the current pathways scenario) for 2040 in nine countries around the world. We compared these health co-benefits with two alternative scenarios, one consistent with the goal of the Paris Agreement and the Sustainable Development Goals (ie, the sustainable pathways scenario), and one in line with the sustainable pathways scenario, but also placing health as a central focus of the policies (ie, the health in all climate policies scenario). Findings: Compared with the current pathways scenario, the sustainable pathways scenario resulted in an annual reduction of 1·18 million air pollution-related deaths, 5·86 million diet-related deaths, and 1·15 million deaths due to physical inactivity, across the nine countries, by 2040. Adopting the more ambitious health in all climate policies scenario would result in a further reduction of 462 000 annual deaths attributable to air pollution, 572 000 annual deaths attributable to diet, and 943 000 annual deaths attributable to physical inactivity. These benefits were attributable to the mitigation of direct greenhouse gas emissions and the commensurate actions that reduce exposure to harmful pollutants, as well as improved diets and safe physical activity. Interpretation: A greater consideration of health in the NDCs and climate change mitigation policies has the potential to yield considerable health benefits as well as achieve the “well below 2°C” commitment across a range of regional and economic contexts.

	abstract = {The agricultural use and conversion of tropical peatlands is considered a major source of land-based greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, the protection and restoration of tropical peatlands has recently turned into an important strategy to mitigate global climate change. Little research exists that has investigated the impacts and dynamics that such climate mitigation efforts evoke in local communities living in and around peatlands. We present insights on this from Sumatra, Indonesia and use a climate justice lens to evaluate local outcomes. We show how an increasingly transnational network of state and non-state actors has become involved in developing new laws, policy programs and land-use agreements on Sumatra's coastal peatlands, aiming at supposedly win–win low-carbon development pathways. We argue that such efforts are open to much of the same criticism that has been raised regarding previous policies and projects aimed at reducing GHGE from deforestation and forest degradation. These projects disregard local perspectives on development, fail to deliver the promised benefits and, through a reconfiguration of local land-use rights, reduce the capabilities of smallholder farmers to benefit from their land. In sum, our analysis suggests that recent policies and projects aimed at mitigating GHGE from tropical peatlands contribute to a redistribution of the global climate mitigation burden onto smallholder farmers in Indonesia. This occurs through their threefold assignment to protect forests, prevent fires and help restore degraded peatlands. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The change of anthropogenic peatlands to agricultural lands could have negative impacts, namely soil subsidence due to oxidation processes, and reduce the stock of soil organic carbon due to the increase of greenhouse gases (CO2 and CH4) emissions which contribute to global warming. Stability of converted peatlands could be increased through amelioration of soil by applying steel slag. A laboratory experiment was conducted with using factorial complete randomized design with ten combination treatments, including slag application, of peat soil samples collected from paddy fields in South Sumatera. This study determined the effect of steel slag application on reducing greenhouse gas (CO2 and CH4) production from cultivated peatland soils. The first factor of experimental treatment was peaty soil from 5 different locations, and the second factor was the application of steel slag. The highest production potentials of CH4 and CO2 were shown by peaty paddy soils from Kayu Agung and Plaju, respectively, while the lowest fluxes were shown by Indralaya’s peaty paddy soil. Peaty paddy soil from the Indrajaya site produced the lowest CO2 and CH4 compared with other sites.

This work adds urbanization to enrich research on the Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) in Indonesia. The results of this study indicate that the EKC hypothesis was confirmed in Indonesia with a turning point of 2057.89 USD/capita. The research results show that all variables affect the escalation of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. Furthermore, there is a bidirectional causality relationship between emissions with economic growth, emissions with agricultural sector, emissions with manufacturing sector, economic growth with agricultural sector, and economic growth with manufacturing. The unidirectional causality is found in emissions by urbanization and economic growth by urbanization. To reduce the impact of environmental damage caused by the activities of agriculture, manufacturing, and urbanization sectors, it is recommended that the government conduct water-efficient rice cultivation and increase the use of renewable energy. © 2020, The Author(s).},

In its agricultural practice, rice paddy fields in Indonesia is cultivated twice to three times a year. Conventional rice planting method using water inundation and chemical fertilizer can result in the increase of greenhouse gasses emission. One of those gasses is methane (CH4). Methane is formed through the decomposition of organic materials anaerobically in the rhizosphere with the help of methanogenic microbes. The release of methane can be influenced by several factors among them are the nature of the soil, irrigation system, fertilization and varieties used. The strategy to reduce emission conducted in this research are the usage of varieties that are considered to be low on methane emission such as Ciherang and IR64, rice paddy cultivation SRI (System of Rice Intensification) method using intermittent irrigation as well as fertilization. The setting of the intermittent irrigation uses IoT based (Internet of Thing) sensor technology for water level adjustment.

	abstract = {Reducing emissions due to deforestation is considered a low-cost option for mitigating climate change. However, the recent literature suggests higher opportunity costs because of specific deforestation drivers, which render reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+) for mitigating climate change an uncertain, less attractive, and controversial option. Indonesia is one of the largest greenhouse gas emitters. Since 1989, 53.80% of its oil palm expansion has come from forestlands, which has generated a significant amount of carbon emissions. This study uses official data and results from the relevant literature to estimate the costs of oil palm-based deforestation under various scenario assumptions, including different output prices, yields, time horizons, and discount rates. We also calculate the additional cost to preserve a 1-ha forest. We demonstrate that the average opportunity cost from avoiding oil palm-based deforestation is 24.42 USD/tCO2eq in Indonesia, approximately 1.3 times the 2011 EUA carbon price. Additional sums of around 5,466.90–11,042.96 USD/ha should be provided to landowners for the deforestation avoidance caused by oil palm expansion. Special attention should be given to the extensive oil palm expansion in Indonesia and the resulting high opportunity costs for achieving the REDD+ ​target. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Replacement of forest by agricultural systems is a major factor accelerating the emissions of greenhouse gases; however, related field studies in the tropics are very scarce. To evaluate the impact of forest transition to plantations on soil methane (CH4) and respiration (CO2) fluxes, we conducted measurements in an undisturbed forest, a disturbed forest, young and old rubber plantations, and an oil palm plantation on mineral soil in Jambi, Sumatra, Indonesia. Methane fluxes and their controlling variables were monitored monthly over fourteen months; soil respiration was measured less frequently. All of the plantations were managed by smallholders and had never been fertilized. To assess the effect of common management practices in oil palm plantations, we added urea at a rate of 33.3 kg N/ha and thereafter monitored intensively soil CH4 fluxes. The soil acted as a sink for CH4 (kg CH4-C·ha−1·yr−1) in the undisturbed forest (−1.4 ± 1.0) and young rubber plantation (−1.7 ± 0.7). This was not the case in the other land-use systems which had fluxes similar to fluxes in the undisturbed forest, with 0.4 ± 0.9, −0.2 ± 0.3, and 0.2 ± 0.7 kg·ha−1·yr−1 in the disturbed forest, old rubber plantation, and oil palm plantation, respectively. In the oil palm plantation, there was no inhibitory effect of nitrogenous fertilizer on methanotrophy. Annual soil respiration (Mg CO2-C·ha−1·yr−1) was higher in the oil palm plantation (17.1 ± 1.9) than in the undisturbed forest (13.9 ± 1.2) while other land-use systems respired at a similar level to the undisturbed forest (13.1 ± 1.4, 15.9 ± 1.7, and 14.1 ± 1.0 in the disturbed forest, young, and old rubber plantations, respectively). Substrate (litterfall and soil) availability and quality exerted a strong control over annual fluxes of both gases along the land-use gradient. Temporal variation in CH4 was extremely high and in respiration fluxes was moderate, but was not specifically linked to seasonal variation. Further comprehensive and long-term research is critically needed to determine more thoroughly the direction and magnitude of changes in soil trace gas emissions as affected by forest-to-plantation conversion in the tropics. © 2020 The Authors.},

	abstract = {The Indonesian government committed to restoring over 2 million ha of degraded peatland by the end of 2020, mainly to reduce peat fires and greenhouse gas emissions. Although it is unlikely the government will meet this target, restoration projects are still underway. One restoration strategy involves blocking peatland drainage canals, but the consequences of this for smallholder farmers whose livelihoods are dependent on agriculture are unclear. This paper investigates perceived impacts of canal blocks on smallholder farmers and identifies factors that affect their willingness to accept canal blocks on their land. We use data from 181 household questionnaires collected in 2018 across three villages in Jambi province, Sumatra. We found that the majority of respondents would accept canal blocks on their farms, perceiving that the blocks would have no impact on yields or farm access, and would decrease fire risk. Respondents who would not accept blocks on their farms were more likely to use canals to access their farms and perceive that canal blocks would decrease yields. The majority of farmers unwilling to accept canal blocks did not change their mind when provided with an option of a block that would allow boat travel. Our results improve understanding of why some smallholders may be unwilling to engage with peatland restoration. Further research is needed to understand the impact of canal blocks on smallholders’ yields. Engaging with stakeholders from the outset to understand farmers’ concerns, and perceptions is key if the government is to succeed in meeting its peatland restoration target and to ensure that the costs and benefits of restoration are evenly shared between local stakeholders and other actors. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The increasing extent and frequency of fires globally requires nuanced understanding of the drivers of large-scale events for improved prevention and mitigation. Yet, the drivers of fires are often poorly understood by various stakeholders in spatially expansive and temporally dynamic landscapes. Further, perceptions about the main cause of fires vary amongst stakeholders, which amplify ongoing challenges from policies being implemented inconsistently across different governance levels. Here, we develop a spatially and temporally-explicit typology of fire prevalence across Kalimantan, Indonesia, a region with significant contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions. Based on livelihood information and data on climate, soil type and forest degradation status, we find that in intact forest the density of fires in villages that largely coincide with oil palm concessions was twice as high as in villages outside the concessions across all years. Fires occurring in degraded land on mineral soil across all years were also most prevalent in villages with industrial plantations (oil palm or timber). On the other hand, in degraded peatland, where fires are most intense during dry years induced by the El Niño episodes, occurrence rates were high regardless of village primary livelihoods. Based on these findings we recommend two key priorities for fire mitigation going forward for policy across different governance levels in Kalimantan: degraded peatland as the priority area and industrial plantations as the priority sector. Our study suggests a fire prevention and mitigation approach, which accounts for climate, land type and village livelihood, has the potential to deliver more effective means of management. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The government of Indonesia has pledged to meet ambitious greenhouse gas mitigation goals in its Nationally Determined Contribution as well as reduce water pollution through its water management policies. A set of technologies could conceivably help achieving these goals simultaneously. However, the installation and widespread application of these technologies will require knowledge on how governance affects the implementation of existing policies as well as cooperation across sectors, administrative levels, and stakeholders. This paper integrates key governance variables--involving enforcement capacity, institutional coordination and multi-actor networks--into an analysis of the potential impacts on greenhouse gases and chemical oxygen demand in seven wastewater treatment scenarios for the fish processing industry in Indonesia. The analysis demonstrates that there is an increase of 24% in both CH4 and CO2 emissions between 2015 and 2030 in the business-as-usual scenario due to growth in production volumes. Interestingly, in scenarios focusing only on strengthening capacities to enforce national water policies, expected total greenhouse gas emissions are about five times higher than in the business-as-usual in 2030; this is due to growth in CH4 emissions during the handling and landfilling of sludge, as well as in CO2 generated from the electricity required for wastewater treatment. In the scenarios where there is significant cooperation across sectors, administrative levels, and stakeholders to integrate climate and water goals, both estimated chemical oxygen demand and CH4 emissions are considerably lower than in the business-as-usual and the national water policy scenarios. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Conversion of tropical peat swamp forest to drainage-based agriculture alters greenhouse gas (GHG) production, but the magnitude of these changes remains highly uncertain. Current emissions factors for oil palm grown on drained peat do not account for temporal variation over the plantation cycle and only consider CO2 emissions. Here, we present direct measurements of GHGs emitted during the conversion from peat swamp forest to oil palm plantation, accounting for CH4 and N2O as well as CO2. Our results demonstrate that emissions factors for converted peat swamp forest is in the range 70–117 t CO2 eq ha−1 yr−1 (95% confidence interval, CI), with CO2 and N2O responsible for ca. 60 and ca. 40% of this value, respectively. These GHG emissions suggest that conversion of Southeast Asian peat swamp forest is contributing between 16.6 and 27.9% (95% CI) of combined total national GHG emissions from Malaysia and Indonesia or 0.44 and 0.74% (95% CI) of annual global emissions. © 2020, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In response to the food crisis threat due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the Indonesian Government initiates a national food supply enhancement program recognized as food estate which was then established as a part of National Strategic Programs. To maintain its implementation, the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry through PermenLHK 24/2020 allows the legalization of forest land utilization, including the protected forest land for the food estate program. This study aims to analyze emerging conflict norms related to the utilization of the protected forest in Indonesia's food estate program. The method used is normative legal research conducted by reviewing various forestry-related legal instruments and principles in Indonesia. The main findings reveal that the legalization of the utilization of protected forests for food estate projects by PermenLHK 24/2020 does not meet legal certainty and contradicts the norms incorporated in the hierarchical higher related regulations. In connection to climate change, the legalization of utilizing protected forests for the food estate program will open up opportunities for deforestation and encourage degradation of the protected function of these forests. The forestry sector has become one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Indonesia, with deforestation and land degradation as the root of the problem. The implication of food estate becomes a regressive action for the realization of Indonesia's commitment to reduce GHG emissions from the forestry sector up to 17.2% with unconditional mitigation scenario (CM 1) and 23% with conditional mitigation scenario (CM 2) by 2030.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In 2019, the dominant greenhouse gases released into Earth’s atmosphere continued to increase. The annual global average carbon dioxide concentration at Earth’s surface was 409.8 ± 0.1 ppm, an increase of 2.5 ± 0.1 ppm over 2018, and the highest in the modern instrumental record and in ice core records dating back 800 000 years. Combined, greenhouse gases and several halogenated gases contributed 3.14 W m−2 to radiative forcing, representing a 45% increase since 1990. Carbon dioxide is responsible for about 65% of this radiative forcing. The annual net global uptake of ~2.4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide by oceans was the highest in the record dating to 1982 and 33% higher than the 1997–2017 average. A weak El Niño at the beginning of 2019 transitioned to ENSO-neutral conditions by mid-year. Even so, the annual global surface temperature across land and oceans was still among the three highest in records dating to the mid- to late 1800s. July 2019 was Earth’s hottest month on record. Well over a dozen countries across Africa, Europe, Asia, Australia, and the Caribbean reported record high annual temperatures. In North America, Alaska experienced its warmest year on record, while the high northern latitudes that encompass the Arctic were second warmest, behind only 2016. Stations in several countries, including Vietnam, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, France, and the United Kingdom, set new all-time daily high temperature records for their nations. Australia set a new nationally averaged daily maximum temperature record of 41.9°C on 18 December, breaking the previous record set in 2013 by 1.6°C. Daily temperatures surpassed 40°C for the first time in Belgium and the Netherlands. Lake temperatures increased on average across the globe in 2019; observed lakes in the Northern Hemisphere were covered in ice seven days fewer than the 1981–2010 average, according to phenological indicators. Over land, the growing season was an average of eight days longer than the 2000–10 average in the NH. Above Earth’s surface, the annual lower troposphere temperature was third highest to record high, and the lower stratosphere temperature was third lowest to record low, depending on the dataset analyzed. Middle- and upper-stratospheric temperatures were lowest on record since satellite records began in 1979. In September, Antarctica experienced a dramatic upper-atmosphere warming event that led to the smallest ozone hole since the early 1980s. Below-average Antarctic sea ice extent persisted throughout 2019, continuing a trend that began in September 2016. Net sea ice extent was below the 1981–2010 average for all days of the year, and January and June each set a new low monthly mean sea ice extent record. The Antarctic ice sheet continued to lose mass, with the highest rates of loss occurring in West Antarctica and Wilkes Land, East Antarctica. Across the cryosphere, alpine glaciers continued to lose mass for the 32nd consecutive year. Permafrost temperatures in the European Alps were slightly below the record temperatures measured in 2015, while record high permafrost temperatures were observed at a majority of the observation sites across the high northern latitudes. For the first time in the observational record at 26 sites in interior Alaska and the Seward Peninsula, the active layer did not freeze completely, a result of long-term permafrost warming and back-to-back relatively mild and snowy winters. In March, when Arctic sea ice reached its annual maximum extent, thin, first-year ice comprised ~77% of all ice, compared to about 55% in the 1980s. In September, the minimum sea ice extent tied for the second smallest extent in the 41-year satellite record. In the Bering Sea, increasing ocean temperatures and reduced sea ice—which was the lowest on record there for the second consecutive winter—are leading to shifts in fish distributions within some of the most valuable fisheries in the world. Larger and more abundant boreal species, as opposed to smaller and less abundant Arctic species, dominated a large portion of the Arctic shelf in 2018 and 2019. During the 2019 melt season, the extent and magnitude of ice loss over the Greenland ice sheet rivaled 2012, the previous year of record ice loss. Melting of glaciers and ice sheets, along with warming oceans, account for the trend in rising global mean sea level. In 2019, global mean sea level set a new record for the eighth consecutive year, reaching 87.6 mm above the 1993 average when satellite measurements began, with an annual average increase of 6.1 mm from 2018. Ocean heat content measured to 700 m depth was record high, and the globally averaged sea surface temperature was the second highest on record, surpassed only by the record El Niño year of 2016. In October, the Indian Ocean dipole exhibited its greatest magnitude since 1997, associated with dramatic upper ocean warming in the western Indian Ocean basin. While ENSO conditions during 2019 appeared to have limited impacts, many climate events were influenced by the strong positive IOD, which contributed to a large rainfall deficit from the eastern Indian Ocean to the South Pacific Ocean east of Australia. Record heat and dryness in Australia intensified drought conditions already in place following below-average rainfall in 2017 and 2018, leading to severe impacts during late austral spring and summer, including catastrophic wildfires. Smoke from these wildfires, along with the volcanic eruptions of Raikoke (Russia) and Ulawun (Papua New Guinea), helped load the stratosphere with aerosol levels unprecedented since the post-Mt. Pinatubo era of the early 1990s. Indonesia also suffered severe drought and extreme wildfires toward the end of 2019; no rainfall was observed in the East Sumba District of the East Nusa Tenggara Province for 263 days. Conversely, the positive IOD also contributed to excess rainfall over the Horn of Africa from August through December, resulting in widespread flooding across East Africa. Elsewhere, India experienced one of its heaviest summer monsoon rains since 1995 despite a delayed and suppressed monsoon during June. In the United States, rapid snowmelt in the spring, as well as heavy and frequent precipitation in the first half of the year, contributed to extensive flooding in the Midwest throughout spring and summer, notably the Mississippi and Missouri basins. Dry conditions persisted over large parts of western South Africa, in some locations having continued for approximately seven years. Antecedent dry conditions and extreme summer heat waves pushed most of Europe into extreme drought. Due in part to precipitation deficits during December 2018 to January 2019—the peak of the rainy season—wildfires scorched vast areas of the southern Amazonian forests in Bolivia, Brazil, and Peru, as well as in northern Paraguay, later in 2019. Millions of trees and animals perished, with some local extinctions reported. In Siberia, fire activity during the summer was both strong and farther north than usual. This led to a new record of 27 teragrams (1012 g) of carbon emitted from fires in the Arctic, which was more than twice as high than in any preceding year. Closer to the equator, 96 named tropical storms were observed during the Northern and Southern Hemisphere storm seasons, well above the 1981–2010 average of 82. Five tropical cyclones reached Saffir–Simpson scale Category 5 intensity. In the North Atlantic basin, Hurricane Dorian caused unprecedented and tremendous devastation, with over 70 fatalities and damages totaling $3.4 billion (U.S. dollars) in The Bahamas. Tropical Cyclones Idai and Kenneth severely impacted southeastern Africa in March and April, respectively. Idai resulted in total damages of at least $2.2 billion (U.S. dollars), the costliest storm on record for the South Indian Ocean basin, as well as the deadliest with over 1200 fatalities across Mozambique, Zimbabwe, Malawi, and Madagascar. © 2020 American Meteorological Society},

	abstract = {Extended urban formation and peri-urbanization processes have characterized the urbanization process in small cities in Java, the most fertile island that produces more than half of the national rice production. The process has brought the growth of small cities' urban activities expand to their rural surroundings and reduce the available paddy fields, which increase the impact on greenhouse gas production and spoiling rural resources. Using the case of extended formation in Tegal Region, formed by Tegal City and the two surrounding kabupaten (regencies/districts), this paper aims to discuss the influences of such urbanization process on paddy fields in the region. The analysis uses time serial statistical data gathered from the monograph of the region from 1990 until now. It uses kecamatan (sub-districts) as the observation units that are classified into some groups based on their distance to the city. The result shows that the peri-urbanization process of small cities also brings impacts on the availability of paddy fields, including those that are equipped with technical irrigation systems. Later, a discussion on policy implications of the peri-urbanization process of small cities that can be useful for formulating better approaches in managing small cities' growth in the future concludes the paper.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {At present, primary energy resources for various industrial activities including transportation and electricity still rely on fossil sources, such as oil, gas, and coal. Fossil resources are increasingly depleted from time to time and cause the impact of erratic price increases, resources are increasingly limited and cause various environmental effects due to emissions of greenhouse gases produced due to burning these fossils. Various biological resources in Indonesia can be used as a source of raw materials for the production of renewable fuels as a substitute for fossils. Research on phytoplankton (microalgae) as an alternative to renewable energy sources has been carried out. This research was carried out in Teluk Kupang, which has been known as a habitat for Algae life and breeding. The purpose of this study is to obtain data on the existence and types of algae that can be utilized as an alternative renewable energy source. The research method used was observation and laboratory testing to determine the types of algae in Teluk Kupang. The results showed there were 34 types of microalgae, including species of Nitzschia, sp and Thallassiosira, sp which had cell compositions in the form of cellulose, glucan and oils (triglycerides) that had the potential to be extracted and utilized for the manufacture of renewable fuels and other valuable chemicals. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Peatlands store very high carbon stocks. Damage to peatland ecosystem will have an impact on increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing the risk of climate change. Peatlands governance is important to prioritize the principle of conservation over cultivation. The aim of this study is to analyze and elaborate the conflict of interests between the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO). The methods are normative-legal research to diagnose the difference in the application of law between RSPO and ISPO. The findings show that RSPO as one of the world sustainable palm oil management standards has banned palm oil planting on peatlands based on its 2018 Principles and Criteria for the Production of Sustainable Palm Oil (P&C). Unfortunately, the palm management instrument in Indonesia which is ISPO still provides space for palm oil cultivation on peatlands. Relation of this study with climate change issues is that ISPO ideas are counterproductive to Indonesia's commitment in reducing GHG emissions by 29% in 2030. Indonesia needs to evaluate peatland governance policies to prioritize conservation rather than cultivation.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {One of the most dominant energy sources is the fossil energy. However, fossil energy based power plant is one of the primary contributors of greenhouse gas which is the main cause of global warming. Besides that, the supply of fossil energy keeps on depleting along the year. Because of that, the availability of New and Renewable Energy (NRE) sources to overcome these problems are vital. Up until this moment, several types of NRE such as water energy, geothermal, and bioenergy have been utilized. However, the utilization capacity is pretty low and needs to be enhanced, either by optimizing the existing NRE or by exploring other type of non-fossil energy source as alternative NREs. One of the non fossil energy sources that have the potential is the wind energy. Indonesia has many areas that have the potential for developing PLTB because they have an average annual wind speed of 3.4-4.5 seconds or have an energy between 200 kWh/m to 1000 kWh/m. In operation, the exhaust emissions produced by wind power plants in the form of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and atmospheric pollutants are less when compared to power plants using fossil fuels.

In 2004, the adoption of Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) aimed at reducing the negative effect created by the palm oil industries. This study examined the impact of RSPO certification in the Indonesian palm oil industries on the amount of CO2 as one component of GHG emissions. This study used time series data from 1981 to 2016, collected from the World Bank, the Tree Crop Estate Statistics of Indonesia, and UnComtrade. Vector Error Correction Model (VECM), with the amount of CO2 emissions in Indonesia as the dependent variables, was run against the area used to produce CPO, the amount of CPO produced by Indonesia, the CPO price of Indonesia, and the dummy variable that is RSPO certification. The results show that the model has both short and long-term equilibrium relationships. While the RSPO certification as a dummy variable is not associated with the amount of CO2 emissions in Indonesia. © 2021 Institute of Physics Publishing. All rights reserved.},

The environmental impact that can be calculated by LCA is very diverse, approximately 18 impacts, which called midpoint impact. The most commonly calculated impact is GWP, which is derived from GHG emissions. In Indonesia LCA began to develop and be used by govermnet or industry to calculate impact from their activities especially production of product. One of the industry that use LCA is palm oil industry. Indonesia palm oil is criticsm from both domestic and international level because of the environmental impact and unsustainable. However, production of biodiesel from CPO in Indonesia can reduced emission is 47 % if we compare to diesel fuel. Even though the source of the energy is considered as carbon neutral, the production path can emit various environmentally hazardous gasses. Scientific approach through Life Cycle Assessment can be used as a tool to assess this issue. Number of LCA study on Indonesian biodiesel production come up with different result. This difference could be due to data inconsistency and did not present the actual condition found in the field. According to those aforementioned situations, an effort to address this issue should be conducted by identifying and presenting actual condition of Indonesian palm oil estate.

Indonesia’s awareness of the impact of disasters due to climate change on the sustainability of its national development brings forth commitments at the international level and robust programs at the national level in reducing GHG emissions. These programs have delivered historical achievements, especially in the forestry sector and the energy sector, the two most critical sectors of national GHG emission. Discussions continue on the conceivable green finance support options varying from the banking sector until the facilitation of ASEAN regional cooperation on low carbon sustainable development. The awareness of stakeholders to prevent potentially excessive burdens on Indonesian public green finance has delivered continuing responses to stimulate private green finance to contribute more for low carbon sustainable development. The study concludes with the exploration of current challenges to address in order to boost the Indonesian dominant banking sector contribution up to the next level. © 2021, Econjournals.

	abstract = {Within a few decades, Indonesia has become the largest palm oil-producing country, leaving Malaysia behind. It is undeniable that palm oil has significantly contributed to the economic growth of the country. However, the negative impacts of the palm oil industry are also evident, such as deforestation, environmental pollution, and social conflicts. The palm oil industry has been known as one of the big greenhouse gasses producers, including CO2. Regardless of the pressure from the European Union, the Government of Indonesia (GOI) has committed to sustaining the palm oil industry since there are millions of workforces depend on their livelihood from these industries. Concerning the negative impacts, the GOI requests that each palm oil company has to follow the Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) certification. So far, around 20% of all palm oil industries in the country have received an ISPO certificate. It is expected by 2023, all palm oil industries have been certified by ISPO since this regulation is mandatory. Implementing all ISPO guidelines in the palm oil industry is not only capable of sustaining the industry but also protecting the environment through the reduction of CO2 and other greenhouse gasses. This paper will review the CO2 management in the palm oil industry in Indonesia in the present situation, connected with ISPO as well as RSPO (Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Climate change has forced human being to adapt in fulfilling their energy needs sustainably. In Indonesia, forestry activities has been considered as an emission rather than carbon sink. This study aims to analyze the inputs, outputs, and potential environmental impacts of wood pellet production in a forest company using life cycle assessment (LCA). The wood pellet is made from Eucalyptus pellita plantation. Analysis was made for 1 planting cycle or 6 years, and allometric equations were used to estimate the ability of industrial timber plantation forest to absorb CO2. Production of wood pellet starting from plantation requires inputs as follows: diesel fuel, electricity, NPK and other fertilizers, pesticides, and electrical energy. Those inputs produced emissions, of which the largest was N2O of 551.2927 kg, followed by NH3 of 7.5275 kg generated from NPK fertilizer. Another was PO43- amounted at 0.1792–0.2229 kg from liquid fertilizers and pesticides. Potential acidification came from 13.3675 kg SO2 eq, and eutrophication of 0.4021 kg PO43- eq. The greenhouse gas (GHG) emission was 678.0270 kg CO2 eq from the plantation activities, especially from diesel-based energy consumption, while wood pellet mills only released 0.1053 kg CO2 eq of GHG emissions. Thus, total emissions from 6 years' time of wood pellet production are much lower compared to the average CO2 absorbed by the plantation forest, of which annually is 36.34–67.69 ton ha-1year-1,. © 2021 Jurnal Manajemen Hutan Tropika.

	abstract = {Micronutrient deficiencies constitute a pressing public health concern, especially in developing countries. As a dense source of bioavailable nutrients, aquatic foods can help alleviate such deficiencies. Developing aquaculture that provides critical micronutrients without sacrificing the underlying environmental resources that support these food production systems is therefore essential. Here, we address these dual challenges by optimizing nutrient supply while constraining the environmental impacts from aquaculture. Using life cycle assessment and nutritional data from Indonesia, a top aquaculture producer, we sought to identify aquaculture systems that increase micronutrient supplies and reduce environmental impacts (e.g., habitat destruction, freshwater pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions). Aquaculture systems in Indonesia vary more by environmental impacts (e.g. three order of magnitude for fresh water usage) than by nutritional differences (approximately ± 50% differences from mean relative nutritional score). Nutritional-environmental tradeoffs exist, with no single system offering a complete nutrition-environment win–win. We also find that previously proposed future aquaculture paths suboptimally balance nutritional and environmental impacts. Instead, we identify optimized aquaculture production scenarios for 2030 with nutrient per gram densities 105–320% that of business-as-usual production and with environmental impacts as low as 25% of those of business-as-usual. In these scenarios Pangasius fish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) ponds prove desirable due to their low environmental impacts, but average relative nutrient score. While the environmental impacts of the three analyzed brackish water systems range from average to high compared to other aquaculture systems, their nutritional attributes render them necessary when maximizing all nutrients except vitamin A. Common carp (Cyprinus carpio) ponds also proved essential in maximizing zinc and omega n-3, while Tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) cages were necessary in optimizing the production of calcium and vitamin A. These optimal aquaculture strategies also reduce business-as-usual demand for wild fish-based feed by 0–30% and mangrove expansion by 0–75% with no additional expansion into inland open waters and freshwater ponds. As aquaculture production expands globally, optimization presents a powerful opportunity to reduce malnutrition rates at reduced environmental impacts. The proposed reorientation promotes UN sustainable development goals 2 (zero hunger), 3 (health), 13 (climate action) and 14 (life under water) and requires concerted and targeted policy changes. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Land-use change in tropical peatlands substantially impacts peat emissions of methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) in addition to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2). However, assessments of full peat greenhouse gas (GHG) budgets are scarce and CH4 and N2O contributions remain highly uncertain. The objective of our research was to assess changes in peat GHG flux and budget associated with peat swamp forest disturbance and conversion to oil palm plantation and to evaluate drivers of variation in trace gas fluxes. Over a period of one and a half year, we monitored monthly CH4 and N2O fluxes together with environmental variables in three undrained peat swamp forests and three oil palm plantations on peat in Central Kalimantan. The forests included two primary forests and one 30-year-old secondary forest. We calculated the peat GHG budget in both ecosystems using soil respiration and litterfall rates measured concurrently with CH4 and N2O fluxes, site-specific soil respiration partitioning ratios, and literature-based values of root inputs and dissolved organic carbon export. Peat CH4 fluxes (kg CH4 ha−1 year−1) were insignificant in oil palm (0.3 ± 0.4) while emissions in forest were high (14.0 ± 2.8), and larger in wet than in dry months. N2O emissions (kg N2O ha−1 year−1) were highly variable spatially and temporally and similar across land-uses (5.0 ± 3.9 and 5.2 ± 3.7 in oil palm and forest). Temporal variation of CH4 was controlled by water table level and soil water-filled pore space in forest and oil palm, respectively. Monthly fluctuations of N2O were linked to water table level in forest. The peat GHG budget (Mg CO2 equivalent ha−1 year−1) in oil palm (31.7 ± 8.6) was nearly eight times the budget in forest (4.0 ± 4.8) owing mainly to decreased peat C inputs and increased peat C outputs. The GHG budget was also ten times higher in the secondary forest (10.2 ± 4.5) than in the primary forests (0.9 ± 3.9) on the account of a larger peat C budget and N2O emission rate. In oil palm 96% of emissions were released as CO2 whereas in forest CH4 and N2O together contributed 65% to the budget. Our study highlights the disastrous atmospheric impact associated with forest degradation and conversion to oil palm in tropical peatlands and stresses the need to investigate GHG fluxes in disturbed undrained lands. © Copyright © 2021 Swails, Hergoualc’h, Verchot, Novita and Lawrence.},

	abstract = {By 2019, total Indonesia's greenhouse gas emission (GHG) amounted to 674 MtCO2e, with the energy sector as the largest contributor. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) technology is a promising alternative to reduce CO2 emission by capturing and storing the CO2 underground. However, the carbon market has undergone insignificant development as the CCS development level remains low. Acceleration of CCS development through better policies and regulation is critical to help achieving Indonesia's target to reduce GHG emission by 29% in 2030. Enhancing CCS development becomes one of the government goals. However, this goal is still arduous to achieve due to the complexity that arises in CCS development. CCS development is a complex system; uncovering such complexity could provide insights into factors that play significant roles and shed light on the possible policy options for better CCS development. Nevertheless, it is still less studied holistically from a systems perspective. This paper aims to analyze CCS development's complexity by developing a conceptual system dynamics model of CCS development in West Java as a case study. The conceptual model developed in this study has captured essential aspects of CCS development and identified three possible policy interventions to enhance the CCS development in terms of incentive, local site regulation, and environmental regulation. © 2021 ACM.},

Some of the reasons of greenhouse emission can be industrialization, urbanization, population growth, manufacturing processes, energy consumption etc. In this research paper, the impact of urbanization, industrialization, population growth on greenhouse gases emission has been analyzed. This analysis has been done in the context of Brunei, Laos, Cambodia, Indonesia, Myanmar, Malaysia, Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore and Thailand – the ASEAN countries. The methodology used for the analysis is the bootstrap panel causality test, LM panel test of co-integration, panel unit root test of Pesaran and Shin that permit cross-sectional dependency. The outcomes of the research have proposed that hypothesis of emission of greenhouse gases is valid in Vietnam, Indonesia and Laos. However, these factors play less significant role in greenhouse gas emission in Philippines, Malaysia and Myanmar. These factors have some impact over greenhouse gas emission in Brunei, Cambodia and Singapore too. Based on the overall analysis given in the research, it can be stated that urbanization, industrialization and population growth do have an impact over the greenhouse gas emission. © 2021, Econjournals.

	abstract = {As of 2017, 2.05 ha of Indonesia's total oil palm area has been identified as peatlands. A large-scale peatland has caused oil palm commodities to be a global concern because they are thought to have contributed to the increase in greenhouse gas emissions that have triggered climate change. This research is an effort to resolve the main problems in the cultivation of oil palm on peatlands in a more environmentally friendly way. The main obstacle to oil palm cultivation on peatlands is Ganoderma fungi attacks that cause basal stem rot (BSR) disease, where the attack is higher than in mineral soils. Biological control is a prospective alternative way to control BSR disease. However, its development in peatlands is hampered by extremely low peat pH. The possible approach is to utilize appropriate biological control agents for peatlands. This study aimed to examine antagonistic bacteria's from peatlands to control Ganoderma under low pH conditions in vitro. The bacterial isolates from peatlands were tested for antagonism against Ganoderma and tested for their growth ability in 2-7 pH situations. The results showed that from the West Kalimantan peatlands, Ganoderma-antagonistic bacteria grew at pH 2-4, even though the growth rate had decreased significantly. The isolates were E4B6, E2B12, E2B13, B3B11, and E2B3. These results indicate that these bacteria can be used in controlling oil palm BSR disease caused by Ganoderma in peatlands.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {With the increase of greenhouse gasses and climate change, international regulators faced a challenging task in determining carbon footprint regulations. With global greenhouse gas emissions from maritime logistics accounts for about 2.5%, this study would take to account for shipment containerization strategies under carbon tax regulation to explore the influence of carbon tax regulation on maritime logistics carbon emission reduction. The motivation of this study comes from a real case example of freight consolidation and containerization problem (FCCP) in Indonesia. This study tries to model an actual problem faced by a third-party logistics provider in consolidating goods into various sizes of containers while keeping the total transportation costs as low as possible. The most significant contributions of this study are to incorporate environmental factors into the FCCP model and to illustrate the impacts of various carbon footprints schemes on both cost and carbon emissions. Therefore, shipment containerization strategies under various carbon footprints schemes are formulated to minimize the transportation costs, as well as to lower the amount of carbon emission from maritime and land transport modes. The methodology used is a case-based approach; it depicts product delivery activities from one origin hub in Kaohsiung, Taiwan, to the biggest retailer stores in Jakarta, Indonesia. The aim is to incorporate environmental factors and illustrate how the proposed policy balances both cost and carbon emissions. Under the proposed policy, a new mixed-integer programming model is introduced considering the freight consolidation and containerization problem. Based on the different groups of numerical results, we found that the shipment containerization strategy under carbon tax regulation gives a better outcome in terms of total transportation cost and total carbon emissions compared with the business as usual policy. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Climate change significantly impacts people's lives. Since the declaration of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the nexus of climate change, land use, energy, and water (CLEW) has attracted attention. As an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia, Indonesia was predicted to experience a significant impact of climate change. To minimize the impact of climate change, the government of Indonesia (GOI) commits to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through the Paris Agreement. One of the plans is in the energy sector, in which 87% of existing power plants are made up of fossil fuels. According to the GOI target, renewable energy (RE) should share the national energy mix of a minimum of 31% by 2050. However, RE resources are highly dependent on the natural condition. Currently, Indonesia's long-term planning has not considered the impact of the CLEW Nexus on RE power generation. This paper reviews the generation expansion planning (GEP) method considering CLEW in Indonesia. Systematic literature review (SLR) was conducted as a methodology of the research. Based on the review results, the system dynamics method is one of the possible solutions to the generation expansion planning problems considering the CLEW nexus. © 2021 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Voluntary commitments are playing an ever-greater role in environmental governance at all scales. In the years preceding the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, a flurry of non-state and state actors signed on to various declarations and commitments to reduce deforestation as one globally significant climate mitigation solution. This paper focuses on the Rio Branco Declaration (RBD) and the 30 first-order subnational jurisdictions located in Brazil, Indonesia, Mexico, and Peru that signed it between 2014 and 2018, committing to reduce deforestation 80% by 2020, conditional upon adequate support from the international community. We assess each study jurisdiction’s progress toward that commitment in terms of reducing deforestation, and examine a subset of the potential factors supporting or slowing progress, including the existence of commensurate targets within jurisdictions’ legal frameworks and the international financial support pledged to jurisdictions. We found that progress toward achieving the target was slow and likely unattainable in most jurisdictions outside of Brazil. Among the four jurisdictions likely to achieve the target under current deforestation trajectories, only Mato Grosso State has a target within its legal framework that is more ambitious than the RBD target. We found that the international response to the RBD was sluggish and likely inadequate – with only one financial pledge made in direct response to the declaration and the majority of funding to support jurisdictional efforts coming from one source. We did not find a clear relationship between international finance pledged and progress toward the RBD deforestation target; however, more often, jurisdictions that received pledges earlier have made more progress. We explore what may explain individual jurisdictions’ performance with respect to the target, including specific jurisdictional circumstances, national context, and international support. We estimate that, if current deforestation trajectories continue, the RBD signatories in our study could contribute approximately 3.7% (0.65 GtCO2e) of the greenhouse gas emissions reduction needed to keep global warming at 1.5°C, compared with a potential 5.7% (0.98 GtCO2e) if they were to all meet the RBD target. © Copyright © 2020 Stickler, David, Chan, Ardila and Bezerra.},

About 70% of agricultural soils in Indonesia has been exhausted and over mined and categorized as sick soils. The impacts of CC has already hit Indonesia and caused the rise of temperature about 0.2-0.3 °C per decade and sea level (SRL) about 5 mm per year, drought and floods occur more frequently, the change of rainfall intensity and rainfall pattern, the shifting of planting season and lead to the decreasing of crops yield or yield loss significantly. The CC along coastline (95,181 km) increases and cause a severely more consequence on the livelihoods inhabitants (40% of total population) and decreasing of lowland agriculture. The paddy fields in coastal area until 2050 will decrease around 174,461 ha in Java, 8,095 ha in Bali, 78,701 ha in Sulawesi, 25,372 ha in Kalimantan, 3,170 ha in Sumatera and 2,123 ha in Lombok Island. The effort to restore and maintain the health of soil ecosystem, enhance the productivity and to mitigate and adapt to the climate change can be done by adopting climate smart sustainable agricultural (CSSA).

The concept of circular supply chain practices, which integrates circular thinking into supply chain practices that aim to reach zero waste by exploring novel business models and supply chain functions, has been proposed to address this issue. However, previous studies implementing this concept lacked appropriate methods for structuring an influential model to guide resource allocation, which caused difficulty in developing circular supply chain practices. Thus, a hybrid method is proposed to integrate factor analysis with fuzzy synthetic and decision-making and trial evaluation laboratory methods to enable visual analysis and boost understanding. The results reveal that awareness and engagement are the most influential factors in attempts to achieve zero waste, rather than the recycling, reuse and reduction practices emphasised by previous studies. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {The development of renewable energy has been constantly conducted as an attempt to increase energy diversification, improve energy sustainability and reduce greenhouse gas emissions, including the wind power plant (WPP). Suitable location selection is urgently necessary to achieve optimized output and high economic values. There are multi-criteria to be considered during the selection process, namely wind velocity, climate condition, road access, environmental impact, land use, land tilt, plain condition, distance to residential areas, etc. This study aimed to develop a software supporting multi-criteria decision-making based on artificial intelligent technology, namely fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (fuzzy-AHP) which was implemented to evaluate the WPP location suitability. The method of fuzzy-AHP is believed to be able to generate prioritized criteria supporting the location of WPP with high accuracy. Based on those criteria, there were two locations identified at Tanah Laut Regency, South Kalimantan, Indonesia, as the most suitable research sites. It is expected that studies employing fuzzy-AHP are to be further developed to determine wider renewable WPP locations. © 2021 Tim Pengembang Jurnal UPI.},

	abstract = {In an attempt to increase domestic palm oil consumption, Indonesia has enforced the mandatory use of 20 per cent blended biofuel (B20). This policy is a part of the government's efforts to reduce oil dependency in energy use and greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, the policy implementation is prone to affect water and food availability as the demand for biofuel crops is expected to grow significantly in the coming years. Correspondingly, a sufficient quantity of water, energy, and food resources is considered essential to achieve the sustainable development agenda. The increasing demand for all three resources undeniably places a great strain on its preservation management. On the other hand, the planning and management of these resources are under dissonant sectoral systems. This issue, which can make the balance between the three resources arduous to realize, needs to be scrutinized. The complex relationship between the three resources reflects a complex dynamic system, needing a holistic approach that considers the integration of Water-Energy-Food (WEF) nexus to understand the system better. Therefore, this study aims to understand the trade-offs between the WEF nexus on the production and utilization of biofuel. For this purpose, a conceptual system dynamics model in the form of Causal Loop Diagram is developed to analyze the complex structure of biofuel development in Indonesia from the WEF nexus perspective. The conceptual model shows that many underlying factors affecting biofuel development should be considered when formulating policy for attaining a sustainable balance between water and food resources. © 2021 ACM.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is a global hotspot of plant diversity. The country contains medicinal plants that have immense value to the people and worldwide. However, climate change is affecting the distribution of medicinal plants in Indonesia. In this study, the future greenhouse gas emission scenarios of RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 for a mid-term future projection to 2050 and a long-term future projection to 2080 were used to simulate the effect of climate change upon medicinal plants distribution within Indonesia. In 2050 and 2080, under both RCP scenarios species richness is expected to decrease over more than half the current distribution area of medicinal plant species. Over half of the medicinal plant species populations will lose up to 80% of their distribution area. Medicinal plant species on the islands of Papua, Java, and Sulawesi are predicted to have the largest reduction in distribution area. In addition, two-thirds of species will lose rather than gain areas of suitable climate under the future climate scenarios. Twenty medicinal plant species are identified as potentially being the most threatened by climate change in the future and are therefore the highest priority for conservation actions within Indonesia. Using these results, we recommend areas and species suitable for long term in situ and ex situ conservation within Indonesia. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Sustainability has been greatly impacted by the reality of budgets and available resources as a targeted range of carbon emission reduction greatly increases due to climate change. This study analyses the technical and economic feasibility for three types of solar photovoltaic (PV) renewable energy (RE) systems; (i) solar stand-alone, a non-grid-connected building rooftop-mounted structure, (ii) solar rooftop, a grid-connected building rooftop-mounted structure, (iii) solar farm, a grid-connected land-mounted structure in three tropical climate regions. Technical scientific and economic tools, including life cycle assessment (LCA) and life cycle cost assessment (LCCA) with an integrated framework from a Malaysian case study were applied to similar climatic regions, Thailand, and Indonesia. The short-term, future scaled-up scenario was defined using a proxy technology and estimated data. Environmental locations for this scenario were identified, the environmental impacts were compared, and the techno-economic output were analysed. The scope of this study is cradle-to-grave. Levelised cost of energy (LCOE) was greatly affected due to PV performance degradation rate, especially the critical shading issues for large-scale installations. Despite the land use impact, increased CO2 emissions accumulate over time with regard to energy mix of the country, which requires the need for long-term procurement of both carbon and investment return. With regards to profitably, grid-connected roof-mounted systems achieve the lowest LCOE as compared to other types of installation, ranging from 0.0491 USD/kWh to 0.0605 USD/kWh under a 6% discounted rate. A simple payback (SPB) time between 7–10 years on average depends on annual power generated by the system with estimated energy payback of 0.40–0.55 years for common polycrystalline photovoltaic technology. Thus, maintaining the whole system by ensuring a low degradation rate of 0.2% over a long period of time is essential to generate benefits for both investors and the environment. Emerging technologies are progressing at an exponential rate in order to fill the gap of establishing renewable energy as an attractive business plan. Life cycle assessment is considered an excellent tool to assess the environmental impact of renewable energy. © 2021 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Palm oil has benefits for economic and social development in Indonesia. However, palm oil is faced by several environmental problems most of them due to the land conversion from forest to the palm plantation. Therefore, numerous greenhouse gas emissions and other environmental effects also emitted during palm oil and biodiesel production. The life cycle assessment (LCA) method can be used for the evaluation of the palm oil production process impact on the environment as well as for potentially reducing the hotspot. A literature study was used in the identification of the implementation of LCA for biodiesel from palm oil in Indonesia. Study cradle to grave LCA for biodiesel production in Indonesia was still limited. Gate to gate and cradle to gate system boundary was the major boundary system used in the identification of the environmental effect for biodiesel production in Indonesia. However, numerous study has applied that boundary system and various scenario has been proposed in reducing the environmental effect for biodiesel production. Limitation of the LCA boundary for palm oil production is needed to be enhanced as well. Robust life cycle inventory in a wider range (i.e., cradle to grave) will be needed in order to present this industry in a global forum.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

	abstract = {To increase the renewable energy mix in Indonesia, the Indonesian government has implemented a mandatory policy for the use of a 20 percent biodiesel blend (B20). This policy is a part of an effort to realize Indonesia's commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29% by 2030. This policy also aims to increase domestic palm oil consumption in Indonesia as the largest palm oil producer globally with a total land area of 14.99 million hectares or equivalent to 49.5% of the world's total oil palm land. However, the utilization of renewable energy that can be achieved currently is only around 11.5%, still far from the target of 23% by 2025. The low use of renewable energy is certainly a challenge for the Indonesian government to enhance biodiesel adoption as renewable energy by raising the percentage of biodiesel blended. However, such an enhancement is arduous to do due to the complexity of biodiesel adoption. While capturing biodiesel adoption complexity is important before moving to the next biodiesel blended plan, there is an insufficient effort on this matter. This paper aims to understand the complex structure of biodiesel adoption in Indonesia. For this purpose, a conceptual model of system dynamics approach is developed to analyze the biodiesel adoption complexity and its related policy. The result shows that many underlying factors affecting biodiesel development are considered in designing policies to increase the adoption of biodiesel in Indonesia. Further, the government mandates and subsidies seem to take the most determining factors as the government intervention for increasing biodiesel adoption. © 2021 ACM.},

One effort to reduce CH4 emissions in paddy fields is the utilization of methane-oxidizing bacteria from paddy fields. The study aimed to obtain isolates of methane oxidizing bacteria from isolating and selecting their oxidation ability on three rice agroecosystems. The research was conducted at the Laboratory of the Indonesian Agricultural Environment Research Institute (IAERI), Pati, Central Java, Indonesia. Soil sampling was carried out in three rice agroecosystems, namely technical irrigation (SI), rainfed (TH), and organic rice cultivation (OF) rice fields in Pati Regency. Isolation and purification of bacteria used Nitrate Mineral Salts (NMS) with 1% methanol. Parameters collected were characteristics of morphology colonies, staining of gram bacteria and measuring methane oxidation ability. The results obtained 15 bacterial isolates from three different rice agroecosystems. The highest percentage of CH4 concentration reduction from three rice different agroecosystems during 15 days of incubation were SI5 16, TH6 23, and OF3 23%, respectively. Methane oxidizing bacteria are expected as a technology to reduce CH4 emissions from rice fields. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesia’s new planned capital in East Kalimantan is being touted as a “smart, green, beautiful and sustainable city” but has stoked fears of massive environmental damage to the island of Borneo, one of the world’s most important biodiversity hotspots and carbon sinks. Precedents of other planned capitals can contribute to an understanding of the potential long-term impacts of Indonesia’s new capital. We used historical nighttime lights to quantitatively assess the spatial growth footprint of 12 previous planned capitals, and conducted land-use analyses to identify the potential environmental impacts on Borneo’s natural environment. Our assessment suggests that it is likely that the direct footprint of the new capital could grow rapidly, expanding over 10 km from its core in less than two decades and over 30 km before mid-century. We identified sensitive ecosystems which may be affected by the new capital’s direct and indirect footprint, such as forest reserves, mangrove and peat. Deforestation emissions from the new capital’s direct (30 km) and indirect (200 km) footprint could be approximately 50 MtCO2e and 2326 MtCO2e respectively, equivalent to 2.7% and 126% of Indonesia’s 2014 greenhouse gas emissions. We discuss how planned capitals can spatially restructure the socio-political geographies of cities and nation-states by interacting with meanings, symbolisms and power relations, which may aggravate environmental impacts but also be seized upon as a catalyst for improving environmental performance in Borneo and Indonesia. Finally, we recommend the use of best practices in impact assessment and sustainability as a necessary first step towards protecting Borneo. © 2020 by the authors.

	abstract = {This article analyses the denialist narratives of the negative environmental impact of oil palm plantations on tropical peat by the media of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore. Specifically, we focus on media coverage of the 2016 International Peat Congress, where scientifically misleading claims that it is sustainable to develop oil palm plantations on tropical peatlands were made. We found that media reporting of the denialist narrative is more prevalent than that of the peer-reviewed science consensus-view that plantations on tropical peat could cause excessive greenhouse gas emissions and enhance the risk of fires. Four mutually complementary narratives were used by Indonesian and Malaysian media to construe denialism, which closely resemble the four climate denialist narratives identified by Elsasser and Dunlap (2013). These denialist narratives draw heavily upon information advocated by divergent knowledge communities (Goldstein 2016) and appeal to a nationalist sentiment of ‘us’ - palm oil-producing developing countries - and ‘them’ - western developed countries producing research critical of the industry. The Malaysian press has most extensively deployed this nationalistic sentiment, whereas the Singaporean media has not actively endorsed or rejected any of the denialist narratives. Our findings suggests that media representation of the issue is a reflection of an amalgamation of economic, diplomatic and nationalistic concerns, determined by political, socio-cultural nuances specific to each country. Importantly, our article alerts to the continuation of unsustainable practices as justified by the media to the public, and that the prevalence of these denialist narratives constitute a significant obstacle in resolving pressing issues such as transboundary haze, biodiversity loss, and land-use change related greenhouse gas emissions in Southeast Asia. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Tropical peatlands are a known source of methane (CH4) to the atmosphere, but their contribution to atmospheric CH4 is poorly constrained. Since the 1980s, extensive areas of the peatlands in Southeast Asia have experienced land-cover change to smallholder agriculture and forest plantations. This land-cover change generally involves lowering of groundwater level (GWL), as well as modification of vegetation type, both of which potentially influence CH4 emissions. We measured CH4 exchanges at the landscape scale using eddy covariance towers over two land-cover types in tropical peatland in Sumatra, Indonesia: (a) a natural forest and (b) an Acacia crassicarpa plantation. Annual CH4 exchanges over the natural forest (9.1 ± 0.9 g CH4 m−2 year−1) were around twice as high as those of the Acacia plantation (4.7 ± 1.5 g CH4 m−2 year−1). Results highlight that tropical peatlands are significant CH4 sources, and probably have a greater impact on global atmospheric CH4 concentrations than previously thought. Observations showed a clear diurnal variation in CH4 exchange over the natural forest where the GWL was higher than 40 cm below the ground surface. The diurnal variation in CH4 exchanges was strongly correlated with associated changes in the canopy conductance to water vapor, photosynthetic photon flux density, vapor pressure deficit, and air temperature. The absence of a comparable diurnal pattern in CH4 exchange over the Acacia plantation may be the result of the GWL being consistently below the root zone. Our results, which are among the first eddy covariance CH4 exchange data reported for any tropical peatland, should help to reduce the uncertainty in the estimation of CH4 emissions from a globally important ecosystem, provide a more complete estimate of the impact of land-cover change on tropical peat, and develop science-based peatland management practices that help to minimize greenhouse gas emissions. © 2020 Asia Pacific Resources International Ltd.

	abstract = {Biofuels have drawn the attention of policymakers as a medium to address concerns of energy security, climate change and socio-economic development. The paper examines the biofuel policies of the major biofuel producing nations and analyzes the key instruments being adopted by them during the last decade such as blending mandates, financial incentives, subsidies, import tariffs, greenhouse gas (GHG) emission and carbon trading. The countries are categorized by continent and covers Asia (India, China, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand), Europe (European Union, Germany and France), South America (Brazil, Argentina), North America (USA, Canada) and Australia. The paper assesses whether the blending mandates had the desired impact on realization of policy targets and examines the impact of biofuel policies on the socio-economic development and environmental sustainability in these nations. Most countries continue to use sugarcane, corn, grains, and vegetable oils as feedstock for biofuel production thereby raising concerns about their adverse impact on food prices and food availability to the underprivileged people. Biofuel policies for this paper refer to policy instruments, strategies and programs which were established to aid and manage the production and consumption of biofuels - both ethanol and biodiesel.

The Indonesia's GHG emission reported thru Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) was estimated by Tier-1 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) method, while the O&G company adopts different methodology. This leads to asynchronous GHG emission contribution of this industry to national GHG emission. This paper aims to estimate the GHG inventory from O&G offshore production facility by using American Petroleum Institute (API) Compendium Methodology and compare it with Tier-1 IPCC Methodology. It found that GHG emission estimated by API method is significantly lower than IPCC method. Both methods shown fuel combustion sources are the dominant. GHG emission sources from fuel combustion and flaring have been well identified, but emission sources from venting and fugitive need to be improved. Moreover this study identified that to have more accurate national GHG inventory, the GHG calculation method might be different for each industry segment. This evaluation could improve the future national GHG inventory and as reference for the industry. National emission factors database for O&G industry segment is highly suggested to be developed.  © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2020.},

	abstract = {Empty fruit bunch (EFB), as the abundant residue of palm oil processing in Indonesia, is potential lignocellulosic biomass that can be converted into ethylene. The use of lignocellulosic biomass as feedstock may overcome the problem of fossil-sources depletion in the long term. The Aspen Plus was employed to simulate the entire process of ethylene production. The environmental impact of the process was further evaluated through life cycle assessment (LCA) method in which the global warming potential, acidification, eutrophication, ozone depletion, and photochemical oxidant creation were considered. A cradle-to-gate LCA study of ethylene production from EFB revealed that global warming potential (GWP) had the largest impact to the environment with the value of 1.15 kg CO2 eq/kg ethylene. Utilizing biomass as the raw material for producing ethylene showed a lower impact of global warming compared with the fossil based. The presence of biogenic carbon and lignin content in lignocellulosic biomass may potentially reduce environmental burden. Taking lignin into account as a credited product in this study resulted in a considerable reduction on greenhouse gas (GHG) emission by 83.9%, while the sequestration of CO2 provided insignificant effect to offset GHG emission. © 2020 Curtin University and John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Although several aspects of rice that increase productivity have been well studied and documented, studies are exploring its environmental aspects, including GHG emissions, are still lacking. More research may have been conducted, but only a few studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. Robust data on GHG emissions from rice fields in Indonesia is still lacking, including factors affecting it and technology to reduce GHG emissions. Publications of GHG emissions research in Indonesia have been downloaded from several search engines, including ScienceDirect and Google Scholar, and searches using certain keywords. These reviewed publications reveal that research has only been conducted within controlled environmental settings. Thus, this review focuses on studies that have been carried out in Indonesia and other countries and assesses water regimes, rice varieties, fertilizer, soil types, and organic matter on GHG emissions in rice fields. More research into factors controlling GHG emissions in rice fields (e.g., water management, rice cultivar, soil types, and fertilizer) is still needed. This review identifies knowledge gaps concerning future research and development in Indonesia. The research should meet the needs, either national or global strategies to cope with climate change, develop sustainable farming practices, which will only succeed if there are government policies. Therefore, this research should involve an intensive interdisciplinary approach that includes both researchers and other stakeholders. © 2021 Gadjah Mada University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Recently, biodiesel as a biofuel has a significant role in replacing fossil fuels because of its benefits, including energy security, reducing environmental impacts (e.g., global warming and GHG emissions), and improving the economy in the rural area. However, the utilization of large-scale biodiesel industry faces many challenges, mainly uncertainties that inherent within decision making in the biodiesel supply chain. Therefore, this paper contributes by identifying several sources of uncertainty in upstream, midstream, and downstream along the biodiesel supply chain. The sources of uncertainty were investigated by using a fishbone diagram as the tool to identify the root causes in which its elements derived from the Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) model. SCOR model provides several basic supply chain processes, i.e., plan, source, make, and deliver. Due to these uncertainty issues related to the biodiesel supply chain, it highlights the need to set performance measures to be achieved through the alignment of supply chain strategies. In the Indonesian context, critical uncertainty sources in the biodiesel supply chain are oil palm supply, oil palm price, land farming, CPO price, CPO supply, production, and operation, technology, policy and regulation, transportation and logistics, biodiesel price, and biodiesel demand. Key performance measures for each source of uncertainty are also determined, such as oil palm yields and oil palm quality for biomass supply uncertainty. The uncertainty management strategies discussed refer to lean strategies, but agile or hybrid strategies are also considered. Future research directions are also presented in this paper. © 2020 ACM.},

	abstract = {Consumers are increasingly demanding products containing palm oil produced without harm to the environment. The industry response to this demand has been the creation of the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and the development of a certification system to ensure sustainable palm oil production. However, currently there is no scientific evidence of the benefit gained through the RSPO certification schema. This paper quantifies the environmental impacts of RSPO certified and non-certified through a detailed Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of 1 kg of RBD palm oil to factory gate, produced in Indonesia and Malaysia in 2016, to identify potential benefits and trade-offs of RSPO certification. The ISO 14040/14044 compliant LCA is carried out following both a consequential and an attributional LCA approach. The inventory model presents a high level of detail. Primary inventory data describing the certified production system are obtained from RSPO assessment reports, covering 73% (634 estates) of the certified estate, including 111 smallholders, and 58% (165 oil mills) of the certified mills. Data for the total industrial production are drawn from national statistics and scientific literature. The non-certified flows are derived by subtracting the certified flows from the total industry flows. The consequential results show that RSPO certified oil reduces GHG emission by 35% compared to non-certified i.e. 3.41 (2.61–4.48) kg CO2 eq./kg for certified vs 5.34 (3.34–8.16) kg CO2 eq./kg for non-certified. Based on a thorough data quality assessment and uncertainty analysis, this result is deemed sufficiently robust and thus conclusive. Certified production achieves the largest GHG emissions reduction because of higher yields, i.e. less land use per unit of product, less oil palm cultivated on peat soil and higher share of palm oil mill effluents treated with biogas capture technologies. We also found that nature occupation is reduced by 20% in certified production while respiratory inorganic is slightly higher (3%) in certified production, due to the larger use of fertilisers. For other impact categories, results are associated with a larger uncertainty and therefore shall be considered as indicative. Similar results are found in attributional modelling. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Increasing milk yield per cow is considered a promising climate change mitigation strategy for small-scale dairy farms in developing countries. As it can be difficult to increase cow productivity, mitigation options beyond this production strategy need to be identified. The aim of this study was to identify entry points for mitigation of GHG emissions in small-scale dairy farms in Lembang Sub-district, West Java, Indonesia. Data on herd composition, productivity, feeding, and manure management were collected in a survey of 300 randomly selected dairy farms. Characteristics of farms with the 25% lowest (<3291 kg milk/cow/y), medium 50% (3291–4975 kg milk/cow/y), and 25% highest milk yields (≥4976 kg milk/cow/y) were compared. Life cycle assessment was then performed to estimate the cradle-to-farm gate GHG emission intensity (EI) of farms. The relationship between EI and milk yield per cow for all farms was modeled and farms with an EI below and above their predicted EI were compared (“low” and “high” EI farms). Results showed that milk yield explained 57% of the variance in EI among farms. Farms with medium and high milk yields were more often specialized farms, fed more tofu waste and compound feed, and had higher feed costs than farms with low milk yields (P < 0.05). Farms with high milk yields also applied less manure on farm land than farms with low milk yields (P < 0.05). Low EI farms had fewer cows, and fed less rice straw, more cassava waste, and more compound concentrate feed (particularly the type of concentrates consisting largely of by-products from milling industries) than high EI farms (P < 0.05). In addition, low EI farms discharged more manure, stored less solid manure, used less manure for anaerobic digestion followed by daily spreading, and applied less manure N on farmland than high EI farms (P < 0.05). Some associations were affected by confounding factors. Farm management factors associated with milk yield and the residual variation in EI were considered potential entry points for GHG mitigation. Feeding less rice straw and discharging manure, however, were considered unsuitable mitigation strategies because of expected trade-offs with other environmental issues or negative impacts on food-feed competition. © Copyright © 2019 de Vries, Zahra, Wouters, van Middelaar, Oosting, Tiesnamurti and Vellinga.},

	abstract = {The Indonesian transportation sector is currently the nation's largest consumer of petroleum products and a significant source of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions overall. Many policies have been implemented by central and local governments, from the introduction of alternative fuels until demand management like odd-even policy; results, however, are in most cases disappointing. This paper explained a system dynamics model for the road transportation sector in Indonesia. The model considers basic policy options under Activity, Structure, Intensity, and Fuel (ASIF) framework and includes two main objectives, i.e., reduction of energy consumption and CO2 emission. Policy scenarios were developed to cover business as usual (REF), transport demand management (TDM), the introduction of fuel economy (FE) standard and feebate system (FEE), adoption of electric vehicles (EV) which considers future technological improvement factors and fuel switching strategy. The result indicates that it is mandatory to have a policy mix as the most effective strategy to reduce energy consumption, CO2 emission and achieve national energy mix target in 2050. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Palm oil is important commodity for the world since it is a raw material for various important products such as cooking oils, cosmetics, and foods. Moreover, palm oil is found as a source for renewable energy such as biodiesel and biogas. As the result, the demand of palm oil is projected to jump in the future. To fulfil this demand, the increasing of palm oil production is unavoidable. Crude palm oil process is one substantial process to produce palm oil. This process becomes source of income for countries and citizen of those countries where crude palm oil are produced such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. Despite of these positive impacts, the environmental impacts of crude palm oil process such as greenhouse gas emission, waste, high water and energy consumption are identified. Thus, to maintain sustainability in palm oil production, several standards such as Indonesia Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO) and Roundtable Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) are introduced. One main requirement from these standards is to monitor sustainability impacts of crude palm oil production. Sustainability assessment is a procedure to evaluate sustainability impacts of products, process and policies. This paper aims to review sustainability assessment process applied in crude palm oil production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The sustainable management of palm oil can be achieved through a regulatory approach. Indonesia as one of the largest palm oils producing countries in the world is committed to achieving sustainable palm oil management in order to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as an effort to combat climate change impact. The concretization of this commitment is to require the Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 concerning Palm Moratorium. However, the Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 has limitations in its authority to be implemented. Therefore, it requires synchronization with relevant regulations to provide a strong legal position for the implementation of the Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to analyze the synchronization between the Presidential Instruction Number 8 of 2018 and other relevant regulations. To achieve this goal, the author employed a normative approach in the form of an analysis of the contents of the regulation that needs to be synchronized. The results of this study indicated that there are fundamental problems at the level of regulation regarding the sustainable palm oil management that are contradictory to each other, making it difficult for Indonesia to fulfill its commitment to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases to combat climate change as part of its effort to combat climate change. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {A continuous rise in the global demand for palm oil has resulted in the large-scale expansion of oil palm plantations and generated environmental controversy. Efforts to increase the sustainability of oil palm cultivation include the recycling of oil mill and pruning residues in the field, but this may increase soil methane (CH4) emissions. This study reports the results of yearlong field-based measurements of soil nitrous oxide (N2O) and CH4 emissions from commercial plantations in North Sumatra, Indonesia. One experiment investigated the effects of soil-water saturation on N2O and CH4 emissions from inorganic fertilizers and organic amendments by simulating 25 mm rainfall per day for 21 days. Three additional experiments focused on emissions from (a) inorganic fertilizer (urea), (b) combination of enriched mulch with urea and (c) organic amendments (empty fruit bunches, enriched mulch and pruned oil palm fronds) applied in different doses and spatial layouts (placed in inter-row zones, piles, patches or bands) for a full year. The higher dose of urea led to a significantly higher N2O emissions with the emission factors ranging from 2.4% to 2.7% in the long-term experiment, which is considerably higher than the IPCC standard of 1%. Organic amendments were a significant source of both N2O and CH4emissions, but N2O emissions from organic amendments were 66%–86% lower than those from inorganic fertilizers. Organic amendments applied in piles emitted 63% and 71% more N2O and CH4, respectively, than when spread out. With twice the dose of organic amendments, cumulative emissions were up to three times greater. The (simulated) rainwater experiment showed that the increase in precipitation led to a significant increase in N2O emissions significantly, suggesting that the time of fertilization is a critical management option for reducing emissions. The results from this study could therefore help guide residue and nutrient management practices to reduce emissions while ensuring better nutrient recycling for sustainable oil palm production systems. © 2019 The Authors.

The Paris agreement binds countries to limit greenhouse gas emissions with the aim of limiting global temperature rise to 2 degrees Celsius relative to pre-industrial levels.

In fact, this year's fog may even be the worst in history, with Indonesia itself reporting the death toll and half a million people suffering from respiratory diseases. Nobody knows when doomsday will happen. But now, the world has begun the process of mass extinction, and humans can become one of the first victims of the mass extinction process. Experts agree to call it the sixth mass extinction. One researcher, Paul Ehrlich, a Stanford University biology professor said that in the 4.5 billion years of Earth's life, there have been 5 mass extinctions that occurred, mass extinctions occurred 65 million years ago, which brought the extinction of dinosaurs. The fourth industrial revolution is a big leap for the industrial sector, where information and communication technology is fully utilized.

Understanding the response of the IOD to a warmer climate has been largely limited to studies of individual coupled general circulation models or multi-model ensembles. This has provided valuable insight into the IOD’s projected response to increasing greenhouse gases but has limitations in accounting for the role of internal climate variability. Using the Community Earth System Model Large Ensemble (CESM-LE), the IOD is examined in thirty-five present-day and future simulations to determine how internal variability influences properties of the IOD and their response to a warmer climate. Despite small perturbations in the initial conditions as the only difference between ensemble members, significant relationships between the mean state of the IO and the IOD arise, leading to a spread in the projected IOD responses to increasing greenhouse gases. This is driven by the positive Bjerknes feedback, where small differences in mean thermocline depth, which are caused by internal climate variability, generate significant variations in IOD amplitude, skewness, and the climatological zonal sea surface temperature gradient. © 2018, The Author(s).},

The aim of this study was to estimate the contribution of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission from livestock sector by using ALU tool version 6.0.1, in West Java Province in year 2016 as the case study. The emission were calculated by using Tier-1 and Tier-2 methodologies. Data used were livestock population and emission factors (EF) of CH4 and N2O of any livestock. The results showed that emission from enteric fermentation was 94.754 Gg CH4/year or 2,368.850 Gg CO2e/year with the highest emission from sheep (50.194 Gg CH4/year or 1,254.850 Gg CO2/year). While emission of CH4 from manure was 6,767 Gg CH4/year or 169,175 Gg CO2e/year with the highest emission from dairy cattle (2,870 Gg CH4/year or 71,750 Gg CO2e/year) and direct N2O emission from manure was 0.366 Gg N2O/year or 109.138 Gg CO2e/year with the highest emission from sheep (0.189 Gg N2O/year or 56.212 Gg CO2e/year). As a conclusion, total emission from the livestock sector in West Java Province was 2,647.163 Gg CO2e/year with the largest emission was from enteric fermentation (2,368.850 Gg CO2e/year).

The empirical findings confirm the existence of long-run equilibrium, and the regressing coefficients of fully-modified OLS (FMOLS) indicate that (a) impacting features of the inverted U-shaped curve of Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) theory appear in a few countries, such as Mexico, Croatia, Kazakhstan, Iran, Algeria, Indonesia, and Thailand; (b) the energy consumption has statistically positive and significant impacts on boosting the carbon emissions; (c) the negative effect of international trade emerges in the developing nations enjoying trade surpluses; and (d) fossil energy share poses a mixed impact. This paper reveals that the vast and inspiring contribution of developing countries to global carbon emission reduction should attract more international attention and assistance. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Industries that are established in Indonesia with the materials of coal, oil, and gas are the largest contributors to environmental pollution. Rapid industrial development in Indonesia has a negative impact on the decline in environmental quality. Companies participation in preventing environmental pollution creates carbon emission disclosure in contributing to reducing greenhouse gases. Objective: This study aimed to determine the effect of firm size, media exposure, profitability, and leverage on carbon emission disclosure in companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange with PROPER criteria. Method: This study was conducted by taking samples of 144 companies from 2011 to 2013. Company samples were selected through a purposive sampling method with PROPER criteria obtained from the Ministry of Environment Publication and have been listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange from 2011 2013. This study used quantitative types of research. Data were then analyzed using regression analysis. Results: Mean carbon emission disclosure during 2011-2013 was 0.588 which showed that there was no extreme variation in carbon emission disclosure data. Mean total assets of the company in this study was 29.49. Mean profitability with Return On Asset was 0.08. The mean company revealed in the media from 2011-2013 was 0.32 (32.4%). The mean value of leverage was 0.42 (42.4%), and there was no extreme value. Conclusion: Variables that affected carbon emission disclosure are firm size, media exposure, and leverage that significantly influence partially. However, the profitability variable did not show a significant effect on carbon emission disclosure. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Indonesia's electricity demand is growing rapidly, driven by robust economic growth combined with unprecedented urbanization and industrialization. Energy-efficiency improvements could reduce the country's electricity demand, thus providing monetary savings, greenhouse gas and other pollutant reductions, and improved energy security. Perhaps most importantly, using energy efficiency to lower peak electricity demand could reduce the risk of economically damaging power shortages while freeing up funds that would otherwise be used for power plant construction. We use a novel bottom-up modeling approach to analyze the potential of energy efficiency to reduce Indonesia's electricity demand: the LOAD curve Model (LOADM) combines total national electricity demand for each end use—as modeled by the Bottom-Up Energy Analysis System (BUENAS)—with hourly end-use demand profiles. We find that Indonesia's peak demand may triple between 2010 and 2030 in a business-as-usual case, to 77.3 GW, primarily driven by air conditioning and with important contributions from lighting and refrigerators. However, we also show that appliance and lighting efficiency improvements could hold the peak demand increase to a factor of two, which would avoid 26.5 GW of peak demand in 2030. These results suggest that well-understood programs, such as minimum efficiency performance standards, could save Indonesia tens of billions of dollars in capital costs over the next decade and a half. © 2019 The Authors},

	abstract = {This study investigated spatial factors controlling CO2, CH4, and N2O fluxes and compared global warming potential (GWP) among undrained forest (UDF), drained forest (DF), and drained burned land (DBL) on tropical peatland in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. Sampling was performed once within two weeks in the beginning of dry season. CO2 flux was significantly promoted by lowering soil moisture and pH. The result suggests that oxidative peat decomposition was enhanced in drier position, and the decomposition acidify the peat soils. CH4 flux was significantly promoted by a rise in groundwater level, suggesting that methanogenesis was enhanced under anaerobic condition. N2O flux was promoted by increasing soil nitrate content in DF, suggesting that denitrification was promoted by substrate availability. On the other hand, N2O flux was promoted by lower soil C:N ratio and higher soil pH in DBL and UDF. CO2 flux was the highest in DF (241 mg C m-2 h-1) and was the lowest in DBL (94 mg C m-2 h-1), whereas CH4 flux was the highest in DBL (0.91 mg C m-2 h-1) and was the lowest in DF (0.01 mg C m-2 h-1), respectively. N2O flux was not significantly different among land uses. CO2 flux relatively contributed to 91-100% of GWP. In conclusion, it is necessary to decrease CO2 flux to mitigate GWP through a rise in groundwater level and soil moisture in the region. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Local roads, which comprise 91% of the road networks in Indonesia, are a vital part of the transportation infrastructure. The construction of local roads has had some negative impacts on the environment, one of the most significant of which is the release of greenhouse gases (GHG). In order to develop a strategy for sustainable development in transportation infrastructure, it is essential that GHG emissions be reduced in the local road construction cycle. The aims of this study were to estimate the release of GHG and to elaborate on efforts to reduce GHG emissions in the construction of both rigid and flexible local road pavements. First, a life cycle assessment was performed to calculate the energy consumption and amount of GHG emissions. Next, some possible approaches were explored and elaborated on to seek opportunities to reduce GHG emissions, and therefore, enhance the sustainability of local road constructions. The results showed that material processing and material transportation contributed to 74.0-75.2% and 24.7-26.5% of GHG emissions, respectively. It is also known from the stepwise analysis that the significant predictor to form the amount of GHG both on the rigid and flexible pavement is the distance of the aggregate source to batching/asphalt mixing plant. Hence, the strategies for the reduction of GHG emissions, in this case, might be carried out by substituting current construction materials (cement and asphalt) with less intensive GHG emissions materials, and by reducing the distance for the transportation of the aggregates. The result shows that the first proposed strategy, which is substituting cement or asphalt with fly ash and reclaimed asphalt reduces more GHG than the second one. © 2019, International Journal on Advanced Science Engineering Information Technology.},

To address those issue, we analyze trade-offs of those 2 variables in plantation managed by smallholders and compare the result to the one of the companies. The trade-offs are estimated by dividing the GHG emission to the partial factor productivity (PFP) of FFB production based on data from previous LCA assessment. Our study revealed that current practices implementing by smallholders are economically less efficient and ecologically unsustainable comparing from the FFB production practices implementing by companies. For smallholders, the trade-offs of ecological impact and economic efficiency reached 0.86 kg CO2-eq/kg FFB or 2.6 times from the trade-offs of FFB production by companies (0.33 kg CO2-eq/kg FFB). Several changes in nutrient management such as adjusting the fertilizers rate at smallholders in Sumatera, improving the OER from 0.20 to 0.22 for smallholders and from 0.21 to 0.22 for companies, and applying biochar technology are the most promising practices to minimize the trade-off up to 81%. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

This paper outlined pollutant sectors that contribute substantially to GHG emission in Kupang along with its structure, and count an estimated amount of emission coefficients for 27 economy sectors. More in-depth explanation about indirect coefficient pollutant emission which beneficial not only for calculation of the emission amount but more as inventory data for LCA. The paper is investigated review the trends of some priority sectors, then introduction of indirect coefficients of pollutant sectors, and showed the Pollutant Emission Structure for Kupang. After that, an estimated amount of Kupang GHG emission under BAU is also counted and confirmed. The paper only considers GHG emission issues while air pollutant emission only be provided as inventory data but will not be used as exogenous data for this paper. In the final part a brief explanation and implications of GHG emission policy in Kupang are identified. A detailed of input-output data for individual process are provided includes all groups of processes or industry sectors relevant to economy activities in Kupang City. A time period for Global Warming Potential (GWP) 20 year and 100 years are used to forecasted amounts share of total GHG emission in Kupang and Indonesia by 2020 compared to 2010. As results first, the GHG emission and air pollutant coefficients for 27 sectors in Kupang based on method is presented in NIES which use to count the GHG emission. These also become an Inventory data for researchers of regional science in Indonesia, however, geography and socioeconomic conditions in every region is different, so that some criteria will be applied. Second, found total GHG emission in Kupang is 1.0164 x 10-3 Gt or around 0.047% compared to total GHG emission by 2010 and 0.034% compared to total GHG emission by 2020 in Indonesia.

	abstract = {The high demand for unmanned aerial systems (UASs) reflects the notable impact that these systems have had on the remote sensing field in recent years. Such systems can be used to discover new findings and develop strategic plans in related scientific fields. In this work, a case study is performed to describe a novel approach that uses a UAS with two different sensors and assesses the possibility of monitoring peatland in a small area of a plantation forest inWest Kalimantan, Indonesia. First, a multicopter drone with an onboard camera was used to collect aerial images of the study area. The structure from motion (SfM) method was implemented to generate a mosaic image. A digital surface model (DSM) and digital terrain model (DTM) were used to compute a canopy height model (CHM) and explore the vegetation height. Second, a multicopter drone combined with a thermal infrared camera (Zenmuse-XT) was utilized to collect both spatial and temporal thermal data from the study area. The temperature is an important factor that controls the oxidation of tropical peats by microorganisms, root respiration, the soil water content, and so forth. In turn, these processes can alter the greenhouse gas (GHG) flux in the area. Using principal component analysis (PCA), the thermal data were processed to visualize the thermal characteristics of the study site, and the PCA successfully extracted different feature areas. The trends in the thermal information clearly show the differences among land cover types, and the heating and cooling of the peat varies throughout the study area. This study shows the potential for using UAS thermal remote sensing to interpret the characteristics of thermal trends in peatland environments, and the proposed method can be used to guide strategical approaches for monitoring the peatlands in Indonesia. © 2018 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Plastic shopping bags have been used in everyday life. In fact, plastic bags production from polyethylene will cause greenhouse gas emission when broken down into small pieces, and hence they contribute to anthropogenic climate change sources. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of environmental knowledge, perceived value and price, product appearance, attitude, subjective norm, perceived behavioral control and intention to purchase reusable shopping bags. The purposive sampling method was used in choosing respondents and the criteria were the respondents who already knew the reusable bag product and had the intention to buy it. Overall, 110 respondents were considered fit to meet the predefined criteria and fill out the questionnaire completely. The instrument testing and also hypothesis testing were tested by Structural Equation Model-Partial Least Square (SEM-PLS). With regard to Hypothesis Testing, the level of confidence was 95% while the rule of thumb for t-test was even having more than 1.96. The results found that environmental knowledge has a positive effect toward attitude, perceived price on influenced attitude, perceived value affecting attitude and product appearance impacted to the attitude (t-students' value: 2.495; 3.325; 3.932; and 10.028 successively).

	abstract = {                             Restoration of deforested and drained tropical peat swamp forests is globally relevant in the context of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. The seasonal flux of carbon dioxide (CO                             2                             ), methane (CH                             4                             ), and nitrous oxide (N                             2                             O) in a restoration concession in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia, was measured in the two contrasting land covers: shrubs and secondary forests growing on peatlands. We found that land covers had high, but insignificantly different, soil carbon stocks of 949 + 56 and 1126 + 147 Mg ha                             −1                             , respectively.

The significant difference in mean soil temperature in the shrubs (31.2 °C) and secondary peat swamp forests (26.3 °C) was responsible for the difference in total CO                             2                              fluxes of these sites. We also found the mean annual total soil respiration was almost equally partitioned between heterotrophic respiration (20.8 + 1.3 Mg ha                             −1                              year                             −1                             ) and autotrophic respiration (22.6 + 1.5 Mg ha                             −1                              year                             −1                             ).

	abstract = {                             It is widely known that tropical peatlands, including peat swamp forests (PSFs), provide numerous ecosystem services in both spatial and temporal dimensions. These include their role as large stores for organic carbon, which when not managed well could be released as carbon dioxide and methane, accelerating climate warming. Massive destruction and conversion of peatlands occur at an alarming rate in some regions. We hope that the lessons learned from those regions currently under siege from conversion can inform other regions that are at the precipice of mass conversion to agriculture. Much has been learned about high latitude, northern hemisphere peatlands but less is known about tropical peatlands. We collate, analyze, and synthesize the evidence revealed from the set of articles in this special issue. This special issue is a step forward, presenting new information generated from a considerable amount of field data collected from peatlands across the tropics in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The hard data collected using comparable scientific methodologies are analyzed and compared with existing published data to form a larger dataset as scientific evidence. The synthesis is then interpreted to generate new knowledge to inform the policy community on how to strategize the sustainable management of tropical peatlands. Carbon (C) stocks in tropical peatland ecosystems can be as large as 3000 Mg C ha                             −1                             , but the rate of loss is also phenomenal, causing substantial emissions of greenhouse gases of more than 20 Mg C ha                             −1                              year                             −1                             . These losses have mainly taken place in Southeast Asia, particularly Indonesia, where peatland development for oil palm and pulpwood has accelerated over the past few decades. Although peatlands in the Amazon and Congo Basin are less developed, it is possible that the same unsustainable pathway would be followed in these regions, if lessons from the dire situation in Southeast Asia are not learned. Strong policies to halt further loss of tropical peatlands may be drawn up and combined with incentives that promote a global agenda under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change 21st Conference of the Parties, Paris, France, Agreement. However, we also propose a framework to address national and local agendas that can be implemented under the nationally determined contributions (NDCs) by balancing conversion/development and conservation/restoration objectives.                          © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The focus of this article is on the potential land use change impacts associated with the oilseed-based biodiesel consumption. The three main crops used for biodiesel production to date are oilseed rape (OSR), soybeans and oil palm. Therefore, the objective of this paper is to provide a technical assessment of potential land use change arising from the growth of these three major crops at global level, obtained through a broad country-level analysis for their respective major producing countries. The article presents an historical data analysis, evaluating the interaction between the expansion and contraction of these three crops over the last three decades (with a closer look from 2008) together with the carbon stock changes to the land. We categorise the land use by its carbon stock and resulting carbon stock changes from land use change. Crops aimed at the production of ethanol, such as maize (corn), sugarcane, wheat, cassava and sugar beet, although extremely relevant for biofuel policies, are not the subject of this present study. While we did not know at the time of writing this report how the term "significant" would be defined in the EU delegated act we concluded from the analysis of the historical data and using the high ILUC-risk definition as it stands, that the emissions associated with palm and soy are significant. For oil palm, we take Indonesia and Malaysia as proxy for the global position. We calculate an average expansion of 29% on high carbon stock land. For soy, we calculate a global average of 19% expansion. We calculate the global average greenhouse gas emissions intensities based on the ILUC-risks as 56 gCO2eq/MJ for soy oil and 108 gCO2eq/MJ for palm oil. Future projections (OECD-FAO, 2017) suggest these numbers could drop significantly. We do not find evidence for high ILUC-risk expansion of oilseed rape. © A. Strapasson.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is one of the largest palm oil producers in the world. Palm oil has a wide range of derivative products that have higher values than in the upstream oil palm products. Indonesia still exports mostly crude palm oil rather than its derivatives. The objective of this research is to obtain the best strategy of developing downstream palm oil industry by considering the total price and greenhouse gas emission. Economic objective function is the total selling price of all products and environmental objective measured by the total greenhouse gas emissions. Multi-objective optimization is based on State-Task Network superstructure with fixed variable of product selling price, emission factor, conversion factor, national demand and global demand of the products. Multi-objective optimization is carried out using GAMS with Cplex 12.6.3 solver. The total selling price obtained amounted to 51.67 billion USD and total GHG emissions generated were 88.05 million tons CO2e. The selected production pathway is the production of 54 palm oil derivatives products to meet domestic needs and 21 of them can be exported (1 FFB derivative product, 4 CPO derivative products, 1 POME derivative product, 4 EFB derivative products, 2 PKS derivative products, and 9 Palm Kernel derivative products). © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Methanogenic archaea contribute to CH4 production in the rice field and control CH4 emission rates; an important greenhouse gas significantly emitted from the rice field. Characteristic of archaeal and methanogenic community in Indonesian rice field has not been well documented. In this study, rice plants grown in the rice field were treated with two different fertilizer applications, i.e., 100% urea without biofertilizer (250 kg ha-1) (B0), and 50% urea (125 kg ha-1) with biofertilizer consisted of methanotrophic bacteria and N2O-reducing bacteria (B1). Soil archaeal community of the two types of fertilization was characterized over the rice-growing period using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. The succession and dynamic of the archaeal population were detected in each of the two treatments before fertilizer application (0 days after transplanting [DAT]) until the rice generative phase (69 DAT). During the period, the archaeal soil community in both treatments was dominated by Crenarchaeota. The relative abundance of putative methanogens was higher in the B0 treatment than that of B1 treatment. Within the methanogenic community, Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomassiliicoccaceae which found as most dominant group in both treatments were presumably to be important contributors to CH4 emission. The application of 50% urea with biofertilizer (B1) changed the structure of the archaeal and methanogenic community in the rice field compared to the application of 100% urea (B0). © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

	abstract = {Rainfed lowland covers about 2.1 million ha in Indonesia that are generally distributed in Java, Sumatera, Kalimantan, Sulawesi, and Nusa Tenggara. Rainfed lowland ecosystems have great potentially to be more productive agriculture to avert possible food shortage. However, productivity of rainfed lowland rice is low due to low soil fertility, lack of water resources and its infrastructure, high weeds infestation, drought stress, and susceptible to climate change. The higher rainfed lowland rice yields can be attained by implementing appropriate crop and soil management technique. Incorporating 5 ton cattle manure per ha into soil significantly increased grain yield of DSR, also improve soil tillage and supply nutrients required by rice plants. The application of composted organic matter, slow release materials, and direct seeded system could reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and water harvesting could be used as adaptation of climate change. During the TPR and the upland crops, the crops often suffer from severe drought, resulting in drastic yield reduction. One of the alternatives to solve drought stress is to collect excess water during the water surplus rainy season in on-farm reservoirs (OFR) and use the water for the dry season crops. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd.

Among various CO2 emission sources, peatlands are dominant ones and the carbon stored in these areas occupies one-third of global soil organic carbon. In peatlands, the effect of drainage canals is significant since the decrease of groundwater level is the major factor in CO2 emission in peatlands and is affected by those canals, therefore grasping the distribution of drainage canal is essential. Few researches have been conducted related to this theme although drainage canal of Indonesia has been known as human effect. These studies leave an issue in terms of accuracy in mapping the drainage canals owing to the characteristics of used methods. The objective of this research is to make more precise drainage canal map in non-forested area in Indonesia using microwave satellite images from ALOS PALSAR-2.

	abstract = {Human activities including modern agriculture have increased the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) since the industrial age. The agricultural sector is a source for three primary GHG emissions: methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O) and carbon dioxide (CO2). Numerous management practices can potentially mitigate GHG emissions from rice fields. Before implementing the practices, it is critical to evaluate its impact on GHG emissions and rice production. The aim of this study is to explore the management practices from paddy fields in Indonesia as mitigation of GHG emission without any yield loss. There were some trade-offs between CH4 and N2O emissions. Continuous flooding triggered largely CH4 emissions and reduced N2O emissions. Organic fertilizer tended to decrease N2O emissions. Nevertheless, inorganic fertilizer e.g. urea application led to an increase of N2O emissions. Promising mitigation options of GHG emission from rice cultivation are the application of water management, a nitrification inhibitor, iron supplement, rice cultivars selection, nutrient (organic-inorganic) management, cultivation method. The effectiveness of the GHG mitigation options varied while acceptability of mitigation options will depend on the extent to which sustainable production will be achieved or maintained. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Recently, it has become a crucial issue due to the rapid increasing amount of waste, along with the increasingly national population in Indonesia. The goal of waste management is as a material recovery (MR), as an energy recovery (ER) and minimizing the environment impact. The plasma gasification modeling was developed based on plasma torch technology to estimate the syngas composition and energy potential. The process simulation is optimized for mixed steam and air as a gasifying agent. This study is to obtain the essential parameter to have the better content of H2 in the syngas, better plant efficiency and lowest CO2 emission for developing urban built environment with lesser greenhouse gases (GHG). Result shows that, the ratio of Steam to Waste: 0.08 %, the air mass flow rate: 1.11∗10-3 kg/s and the steam mass flow rate: 01.11∗10-4 kg/s gain the highest molar fraction of H2 : 32.09%, Syngas Yield : 1.28 Nm3/kg, Carbon Conversion Efficiency : 5.83%, Cold Gasification Efficiency : 77.96% and the CO2 emission : 2.23∗10-4 kg/s. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Today the world is facing global warming as one of its main issues, this is mainly caused by a rise in carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases concentration in the atmosphere. Flaring is one of the major causes of the increase in greenhouse gases, 145 billion cubic meters of natural gas was flared in 2018. Indonesia being an archipelago nation and located near the equator suffers greatly from these global warming impacts. The impacts include environmental degradation, health implications and economic effects. This study is intended to develop a power plant configuration that can be adopted at an already existing plant to use flare gas as a complementary fuel. The energy of the flare gas will be converted into mechanical energy through thermal power plant instead of being vented as presently. Two possible plant configurations were developed and simulated using Thermo-flow and the results were compared. Both configurations employ the combined cycle concept, where a gas turbine is coupled with a steam turbine. The main difference between the two configurations is that configuration 1 uses a Heat Recovery Steam Generator whilst the second configuration uses common Heat Exchangers in-between the gas turbine and the Rankine cycle. The results show that configuration 1 would generate a net power of 40.948MW whilst configuration 2 would generate 32.924MW. © 2019 Author(s).},

Furthermore, the study facilitated and utilized the Greenhouse Gas Protocol V1.02 as a method of life cycle impact assessment, with CO2eq evaluated using fossil fuel, land transformations, and biogenic. The results showed that palm cultivation using crude oil produced the highest pollution source in all categories with the highest at CO2eq. Also, palm cultivation using crude oil production at A, B, and C caused impact categories of 3.2 ton, 3.02 ton, and 2.85-ton fossil CO2eq. These were also extracted from the transportation and production process of crude palm oil in plants that use diesel fuel. Finally, in the production of biodiesel from biodiesel plants A, B, and C, in all categories, the highest impact source of pollution is caused by crude palm oil production. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Waste sector contributes on greenhouse gasses (GHGs) including from waste transportation. As it significantly contributes to the total cost, municipality is most concerned on waste transportation. The paper aims to analyze the role of waste compaction facility to reduce the GHGs emission reduction. Through a sampling procedure for 8 consecutively days, total waste collected from the service area to the compaction facility was 122.35 m3 d-1 with waste density of 103.27 kg m-3. In order to transport all amount of waste to final disposal site located about 45 km from central of Bandung City, Indonesia it requires at least 8 trucks for 2 trips with waste density at truck of 200 kg m-3. Waste compaction results the increasing waste density up to 350 kg m-3. Thus, the truck required for waste transportation becomes 4 trucks. By assuming fuel efficiency of 5 km per litre of diesel and using emission factor published by DEFRA of UK (2.67 kg CO2 eq. per litre), it is found that total GHG emission reduction due to operational of waste compaction is 40% (from 720.9 into 432.54 kg CO2 eq. daily). In fact, the GHGs emission is reduced more when considering the traffic jam along way to final disposal site. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The environment is the priceless gift from God the almighty. Such blessings must always be maintained, managed, and developed for a greater good. The environment has a carrying capacity for life, all living things will be perished if the environment is degraded. As the science, technology, and industry increasingly develop, it has also an impact on the environmental degradation. The environmental degradation in Indonesia as the result of human almost reach its highest point. Deforestation, peatland degradation, and forest fires have placed Indonesia as one of the world's greatest greenhouse gas emitters at number three. This research aims to (1) analyze the application of green constitution concept in Indonesia and (2) study the application of technology in controlling its carbon dioxide emissions to achieve green Indonesia 2030. This research uses normative legal research methods with statute approach. This research uses secondary data as the main data source obtained from library research. It uses documentation method to collect the data to obtain valid information. The 1945 Constitution of the Republic of Indonesia accommodates the concept of sustainable development and provisions on human rights for a good and healthy environment, as stated in Article 28H paragraph (1) juncto Article 34 paragraph (4) of 1945 Constitution. The results of the study indicate that the 1945 Constitution and different laws and regulations below it have not been able to address the environmental issues in Indonesia. Indonesian constitution has a glimpse of “green” nuance. However, the 1945 Constitution only regulates the environment implicitly and has not specifically adopted the environmental sovereignty in some of its provisions. Environmental sovereignty in the 1945 Constitution has not been included in dedicated articles, but inherent on fundamental rights, i.e. human rights to the environment, while the laws under the 1945 Constitution do not reflect the alignment and harmonization of rights assurance for the sustainable development and pro-environment concept. Indonesia is committed to independently reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 29% and by 41% with international cooperation under the business as usual projection towards a green Indonesia 2030. The results show that the application of Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) can maintain the stability of CO2 to not exceed the concentration of 450 ppm in the atmosphere, it also created a negative impact in the environment. A leakage in CO2 storage will cause carbon dioxide to seep through the caprocks pores in the form of flakes through the openings in faults, fractures, or traces of gas or oil drilling. The water around the CCS planting area will become acidic and even an explosion. Moreover, CCS technology is costly and requires large amounts of energy during the separation of CO2 from all the gas released from the burning of fossil fuels and O2 purification in gases to produce a clean combustion. © 2020 SERSC.},

	abstract = {The recent demand for green and renewable energy sources has gained significant economic importance in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Located within a volcanic setting, Indonesia has approximately 40% of the world s geothermal energy resources, hence the geothermal power market is remarkably huge with a reported installed capacity of 1900 MW in 2018, the second largest globally after the United States. The effort to increase the output of this untapped resource is very encouraging and requires good understanding and evaluation of these complex volcanic reservoirs. This includes the structural evolution in the area and locating sweet spots in the lithocolumn for deciphering the controlling factors that govern the producibility within the field. Well logging measurements, including borehole imaging and acoustic tools, were deployed to investigate the characteristics and patterns in the lithocolumn to identify sweet zones for good reservoir sections. The workflow includes borehole imaging-based applications and structural and fractures characterization. The promising sections are correlated to drilling results to delineate optimum zones and the intrinsic properties of the sweet spots. The structural framework is then correlated with the wells in the same field to understand factors that control the contribution of each zone and the lateral continuity of these reservoirs in regard to the overall geological evolution in the area. The assessment was made employing fracture identification from borehole microresistivity images classified based on their morphology into various classification fractures, with effective fracture types being the primary interest. The dominant strike direction of these fracture sets were observed to be north-southerly with aperture values obtained from resistivity imaging estimated between 1 and 8 mm with a mean of 4 mm. The maximum principal horizontal stress within the study area were observed to be in the northeast-southwest direction based on drilling-induced linear features, which were then correlated to the properties of the fractures contributing to steam production. This work provides insight into factors to identify properties of productive fractures for steam gas reservoir production. Understanding the characteristics of fracture properties and geometry in relation to the geological evolution of the structural framework in this area can be beneficial to identifying infill wells for optimum recovery of renewable sources of energy.

	abstract = {Peatlands are very vulnerable, and their existence must be maintained as stores of water and carbon stocks. Moreover, due to improper management, peatlands in Indonesia have degraded, resulting in various environmental problems such as fire, flooding, and subsidence. Drainage on peatlands that is not carried out properly causes the peat to dry out and even become vulnerable or flammable. The peat becoming dry on a large scale has the potential to increase subsidence and greenhouse gas emissions (such as CO2), which can contribute to local and global climate change. The management of peatlands in the cultivation area must pay attention to the unity of the peat area (landscape), including the existence of peat domes. The main parameters that need to be taken into account in land and water management in peat land are (1) Drainability Limits, (2) Subsidence, (3) Land Useful Life, (4) Adjacent Ecosystem Linkages, (5) Peatland Externalities, and (6) Priorities and Prevention of Massive and Disastrous Damage. Water management is one of the most important aspects in peatland management, which needs to be performed by water regulation so that the peat soil surface remains wet, preventing it from drought in the dry season and causing fires, and at the same time preventing flood disasters during the rainy season. Efforts to utilize excess water during the rainy season to cover the water deficit in the dry season need to be endeavoured to minimize wasted water. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Forest and land fires in Indonesia are well recognized, directly or indirectly, as the main contributors to deforestation and greenhouse gas emission related to the global climate change. Usually, local peoples are blamed for those fires especially when negative impact occurred. Fortunately, not all of the local peoples do the same thing as it is shown by Dayak Ngaju in Block A of ex-Mega Rice Project (Ex-MRP) Project area located in Mantangai sub-district Kapuas district, Central Kalimantan Province, Indonesia, where this research was conducted. The objective of this study was to know land the cover changes related to the use of fire for land preparation, and how the Dayak Ngaju people implement their knowledge and experience in the field. This objective was achieved by analyzing satellite images of Landsat 7 and 8 for a period of time starting from 2005 to 2015. Results of the research showed that the local people started clearing the land with fire at the end of September (dry season) or early October (the rainy season) yearly, as it could be seen from the changes of the land cover from secondary swamp forest into swamp shrub and from secondary swamp forest into fields. Meanwhile, at the protected area where peat was dominant, land cover change occurred due to land rights conflicts, and not to the use of fire for land preparation using fire by Dayak Ngaju communities, because they found that the results were not good and the planted rice would die three months after planting.. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

	abstract = {The indicators of economic improvement in energy efficiency have been measured and evaluated globally, one of them was the consumption of energy. However, in Indonesia, the increase in energy efficiency has not been optimally improved in terms of energy consumption, especially for fossil fuel energy consumption and GHG emission. This was caused by the energy resources which was heavily relied on coal-fired power generation and imported crude oil. This paper proposed a solution by providing a good energy efficiency measurement based on the well-developed DEA technique. This study was aimed to provide acceptable energy efficiency, especially any single rupiah of the GRDP produced the people had to consume energy in Indonesia. Thus, optimizing energy efficiency was a key to reduce import dependency, support the green economy, and bring down costs for consumers. This research used input-oriented DEA based on the Charnes, Cooper, and Rhodes (CCR) model to assess the efficiency scores of PLN in Indonesia implemented in the period 2017. The result revealed that the consumption of energy that any single rupiah of GRDP produced, the provinces at Jawa, Bali, Sumatra, Papua, Maluku, and Nusa Tenggara had to consume energy more than one at Kalimantan and Sulawesi. Based on this study, fossil fuel energy consumption and GHG emissions performance in PLN were very crucial for the future of energy assessment in Indonesia. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Forest products are increasingly used in high-tech and high-value-added industries, e.g., chemicals and the automotive industry. So far, however, research on the European bioeconomy has largely focused on agriculture as a provider of food, feed, fuel, and fiber to bio-based industries. Here we assess the potential impacts of a stronger reliance on forestry sector inputs to the European Union (EU28) bioeconomy on output, prices, final demand, and land use. Specifically, we run a sensitivity analysis of a 1% increase of input use of forest products in the EU28 economy in a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) framework accounting for land use by Agro-Ecological Zones (AEZ) and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions at high regional and sectoral resolution. We find that such a shift to a more forest-based bioeconomy would provoke small indirect land use effects globally due to existing international trade linkages and land market effects. Simulated increases in planted forest cover are associated with net GHG emission savings, but our scenario analysis also points to higher imports of forest products from countries with vulnerable tropical forest biomes, such as Brazil and Indonesia. © 2019 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Agriculture is one of the most important sectors for global anthropogenic methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions. While much attention has been paid to production-side agricultural non-CO2 greenhouse gas (ANGHG) emissions, less is known about the emissions from the consumption-based perspective. This paper aims to explore the characteristics of agricultural CH4 and N2O emissions of global major economies by using the latest emission data from the Food and Agriculture Organization Corporate Statistical Database (FAOSTAT) and the recently available global multi-regional input-output model from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD). The results show that in 2014, the 42 major economies together accounted for 60.7% and 65.0% of global total direct and embodied ANGHG emissions, respectively. The consumption-based ANGHG emissions in the US, Japan, and the EU were much higher than their production-based emissions, while the converse was true for Brazil, Australia, and India. The global-average embodied ANGHG emissions per capita was 0.7 t CO2-eq, but major developing countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Mexico were all below this average value. We find that the total transfer of embodied ANGHG emissions via international trade was 622.4 Mt CO2-eq, 11.9% of the global total. China was the largest exporter of embodied ANGHG emissions, while the US was the largest importer. Most developed economies were net importers of embodied emissions. Mexico-US, China-US, China-EU, China-Japan, China-Russia, Brazil-EU, India-EU and India-US formed the main bilateral trading pairs of embodied emission flows. Examining consumption-based inventories can be useful for understanding the impacts of final demand and international trade on agricultural GHG emissions and identifying appropriate mitigation potentials along global supply chains. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {It has been considered that the availability of fossil fuels is getting rare and hence becoming more expensive. Its exploration has moved from onshore to offshore together with advanced technology involved thus causing higher cost to the fuels to be ready to use. This fact has caused (in particulars) the fishermen cannot afford to buy the fuel so that they are vulnerable to live in poverty. Recent survey shows that more than 50% of fishing boats, owned by traditional and low economic income of Indonesian fishermen, has been grounded. In addition, the use of fossil fuels has caused the increase of green house gas (GHG) effects thus its continuous use is not environmentally friendly. The current paper describes the development of catamaran fishing vessel as a part of academic contribution to help the Indonesian fishermen. Earlier work proposed the design of catamaran fishing (cat-fish) vessel using the conventional diesel engine, whilst the new design introduces the use of combination of diesel engine together with the use of solar power. Discussion includes the explanation of lay out arrangement, ship stability and seakeeping characteristics, and energy index due to the use of two power system. The later item has now become a serious matter under IMO (International Maritime Organization) regulation in order to reduce GHG effect. Economic review of the possible development of the novel concept is also taken into consideration because the investment cost of the solar powered boat is predicted to be more expensive than the diesel powered vessel but its operational cost is cheaper hence it is promising in long-term use. © APAC 2013.All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Global warming is a standout amongst the present most critical environmental issues, caused generally by emission of greenhouse gases, for example, carbon dioxide from the consuming of fossil fuels. Emissions of carbon dioxide fluctuate all through nations in Asia. It is progressively perceived that nations must act to advance the more prominent utilization of renewable energy resources as a component of activities looking to relieve environmental change. This paper shows a survey of the energy request situation in Malaysia and Indonesia. In this renewable energy, resources are getting to be attractive for sustainable energy development in Malaysia. It is essential for Malaysia to build the consumption of renewable energy to lessen its reliance on dirty fossil fuels for electricity generation. This paper endeavours to examine the elements influencing renewable electricity consumption (REC) in Malaysia. In particular, our examination means to investigate the long-haul relationship among REC, economic growth, CO2 emanations, foreign direct investment (FDI) and exchange transparency over the period from 1980 to 2015. By utilizing autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds testing cointegration approach, we locate that financial development and FDI are the real drivers for REC. Exchange transparency, be that as it may, is found to have a negative effect on REC over the long haul. Strangely, the impact of CO2 outflows on REC isn’t critical. In addition, the vector error correction model (VECM) Granger causality test finds the presence of a unidirectional causality relationship running from GDP to REC, affirming the legitimacy of conservation hypothesis in Malaysia. Some significant policy suggestions are likewise talked about. It is accordingly prescribed that the policymakers are required to concentrate on the green energy generation part by expanding renewable energy creation from the current sources. © 2019, Econjournals.

	abstract = {As a country with 14.9 ha of peatland, Indonesia is a major contributor of GHG emissions, especially from peat ecosystems. These emissions were caused by peat decomposition and peat fires. However, accurate estimation of peat burnt area was still a barrier that prevented the inclusion of peat fire emission in the document of Forest Reference Emission Level (FREL) as a followup document to REDD+ activities. This research has the objective to analyse two different approaches to estimate peat burnt area used in the FREL document and the most recent semi-automatic approach suggested by the Ministry of Environment and Forestry (MoEF). The study focused on the Gaung - Batang Tuaka River Peat Hydrological Unit (KHG), as one of the KHG priorities in Indonesia. The results showed that the average total annual burnt area from the FREL approach was 58% higher than that of the semi-automatic approach, which could lead to an overestimate of peat fire emissions from this approach. The burnt area identified in this study was found to occur within the production forest area. As stepwise approach is allowed for FREL submission, improvements to a higher precision method are necessary to increase the accuracy of burnt area estimation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {                             The loss and degradation of mangroves can result in potentially significant sources of atmospheric greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For mangrove rehabilitation carbon projects, quantifying GHG emissions as forests regenerate is a key accounting requirement. The current study is one of the first attempts to systematically quantify emissions of carbon dioxide (CO                             2                             ), nitrous oxide (N                             2                             O) and methane (CH                             4                             ) from: 1) aquaculture ponds, 2) rehabilitating mangroves, and 3) intact mangrove sites and frame GHG flux within the context of landuse change. In-situ static chamber measurements were made at three contrasting locations in Sulawesi, Indonesia. The influence of key biophysical variables known to affect GHG flux was also assessed. Peak GHG flux was observed at rehabilitating (32.8 ± 2.1 Mg CO                             2                             e ha                             −1                              y                             −1                             ) and intact, mature reference sites (43.8 ± 4.5 Mg CO                             2                             e ha                             −1                              y                             −1                             ) and a dry, exposed disused aquaculture pond (30.6 ± 1.9 Mg CO                             2                             e ha                             −1                              y                             −1                             ). Emissions were negligible at low productivity rehabilitating sites with high hydroperiod (mean 1.0 ± 0.1 Mg CO                             2                             e ha                             −1                              y                             −1                             ) and an impounded, operational aquaculture pond (1.1 ± 0.2 Mg CO                             2                             e ha                             −1                              y                             −1                             ). Heterogeneity in biophysical conditions and geomorphic position exerted a strong influence on GHG flux, with the longer hydroperiod and higher soil moisture content of seaward fringing mangroves correlated with decreased fluxes. A greater abundance of Mud lobster mounds and root structures in landward mangroves correlated to higher flux. When viewed across a landuse change continuum, our results suggest that the initial conversion of mangroves to aquaculture ponds releases extremely high rates of GHGs. Furthermore, the re-institution of hydrological regimes in dry, disused aquaculture ponds to facilitate tidal flushing is instrumental in rapidly mediating GHG flux, leading to a significant reduction in baseline emissions. This is an important consideration for forest carbon project proponents seeking to maximise creditable GHG emissions reductions and removals.                          © 2018},

	abstract = {Degraded and converted peat swamp forest has enhanced the emission of CO2 and become one major contributor of huge greenhouse gas emission. Management unit at site level of KPH Tasik Besar Serkap covers a very wide area of more than 510.000 ha, dominated by 90% of peat swamp forest (PSF) which is susceptible to several disturbance sources (fires, illegal logging, land encroachment, alien species invasion, etc) and experiencing more deteriorated condition if there is no significant action carried out in managing its resources. Thus, it is important to improve the productivity of this PSF by planting it with native commercial tree species in order to maintain its role both in production and conservation aspects. The main objective of this study was to determine suitable PSF native species to rehabilitate highly degraded PSF in KPHP Tasik Besar Serkap. Two native PSF tree species were used namely Balangeran (Shorea balangeran) and Bintangur (Callophylum soulatri). Seedlings were planted at 4 x 3 meter spacing distance, each species was planted in a 1-ha plot, and thus the planting trial total area was 2 ha with 834 individual trees/species/ha. The survival rates at 6 months and 12 months after planting were 81.77% (682 seedlings/ha) and 58.6% (488 seedlings/ha) respectively for Balangeran, and 12.64% (105 seedlings/ha) and 10.34% (86 seedlings/ha) for Bintangur. The average heights at 6 and 12 months after planting for Balangeran were 111.54 cm (±16.731) and 206.03 cm (± 30.905) respectively, while for Bintangur 60.00 cm (± 12.921) and 72.76 cm (± 11.326) respectively. We also observed physical damage on planted seedlings, namely the occurrence of shoot and twig boring (pest) and seedling mortality caused by herbicide contact when our field staff applied herbicide at the experimental plots to ease the planted seedlings from weeds and other competitors. Borer was only identified in the surviving Balangeran seedlings at 12 months after planting with the intensity of attack of 17%. We did not observe similar case occurring in planted Bintangur. Seedling mortality rates caused by herbicide contact for Balangeran and Bintangur were 3.8% and 3,2% respectively. From the study result, it was concluded that only Balangeran was recommended to be planted for increasing the productivity of PSF in the scheme of commercial stand. © 2019, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Various sectors are now obliged to make reductions, and new policies based on the carbon footprint are being encouraged. However, voluntary reporting of so-called scope 3 emissions is hindering successful implementation of these policies. In this study, we present a tiered hybrid analysis to report emissions according to the ISO/TR 14069 standards and to obtain complete measures of scope 3 emissions. A process analysis for scope 1 and scope 2 emissions is complemented with a multiregional input-output analysis for upstream scope 3 emissions. This novel approach is applied to the case study of a Spanish timber company. Its total carbon footprint in 2011 was 783,660 kilograms of carbon-dioxide equivalent, of which 88% correspond to scope 3 emissions. These emissions are globally distributed; 71% are from European countries, followed by 8% from emerging economies (Brazil, Russia, India, Indonesia, Australia, and Turkey), 5% from China, and, finally, 16% from the rest of the world. We identify and discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this novel approach, the European implementation of which could be highly effective in reducing global carbon emissions. © 2018 by Yale University},

	abstract = {Nizam Zachman is a modern fishery port located in Muara Baru, Jakarta, Indonesia. Some of its facilities include a temporary collection of solid waste and wastewater treatment plants, emitting greenhouse gases that lead us to climate change by warming up the global temperature. In this study, greenhouse gas emissions are estimated from these two facilities by using the IPCC Tier 1 method and emission factor calculation. By estimating greenhouse gas in this area, it will give knowledge and convicing to make greenport as a consideration of the strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emission, starting from waste and wastewater management. Solid waste treatment comprises open dumping, recycling, and transportation of wastes to the temporary landfill in this area. With a total waste of 5, 411.4 tons/year, greenhouse gas emissions from open dumping and transportation are estimated to be 14, 340.2 and 22.3 tons CO2eq/year, respectively. Meanwhile, recycling activities contribute to 143 tons CO2 eq/year of greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, the estimated greenhouse gas emissions include emissions from wastewater treatment, discharge of industrial wastewater to waterways via the drainage system, and domestic wastewater treatment by using a septic tank. In addition, greenhouse gas emissions from wastewater treatment, drainage system, and septic tanks are estimated to be 2, 830; 108.7; and 3.2 tons CO2 eq/year, respectively. Based on the estimation, solid waste treatment generates 83% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, while wastewater treatment generates only 17% of the total emissions. Herein, composting, increase of recycling, and utilization of methane are recommended to reduce the greenhouse gas emissions from waste management. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Sumbawa has the potential to transition into a smart city, utilizing solar energy as their main source of its alternative energy. Located in the tropical country of Indonesia, Sumbawa's dry season lasts eight months, during which it sees a solar intensity of 4.51 watt/m2/h, making solar energy a promising resource for the area. Its level of abundance and no pollution attribute are the main factors that make solar energy an attractive renewable resource. Raw calculation showed that solar energy is able to provide massive amount of energy, while solar panel and photovoltaic can produce zero greenhouse gases when converting solar energy into electricity. However, the high initial cost of installing solar cells hinder popularization of it as an alternative energy source, meanwhile some of the substance materials that compose solar panel may have a negative impact on the environment. This study intends to review the potential for inexpensive semiconductor-based solar panels to be applied as independent source of lighting by analysing the cost and environmental impact. Discussion on simple chemical method without high cost equipment instalment is also highlighted in this work, which offers recommendation of methods that can contribute on lowering the production cost of solar panel. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic greenhouse gases and aerosols are associated with climate change and human health risks. We used a global model to estimate the climate and public health outcomes attributable to fossil fuel use, indicating the potential benefits of a phaseout. We show that it can avoid an excess mortality rate of 3.61 (2.96–4.21) million per year from outdoor air pollution worldwide. This could be up to 5.55 (4.52–6.52) million per year by additionally controlling nonfossil anthropogenic sources. Globally, fossil-fuel-related emissions account for about 65% of the excess mortality, and 70% of the climate cooling by anthropogenic aerosols. The chemical influence of air pollution on aeolian dust contributes to the aerosol cooling. Because aerosols affect the hydrologic cycle, removing the anthropogenic emissions in the model increases rainfall by 10–70% over densely populated regions in India and 10–30% over northern China, and by 10–40% over Central America, West Africa, and the drought-prone Sahel, thus contributing to water and food security. Since aerosols mask the anthropogenic rise in global temperature, removing fossil-fuel-generated particles liberates 0.51(±0.03) °C and all pollution particles 0.73(±0.03) °C warming, reaching around 2 °C over North America and Northeast Asia. The steep temperature increase from removing aerosols can be moderated to about 0.36(±0.06) °C globally by the simultaneous reduction of tropospheric ozone and methane. We conclude that a rapid phaseout of fossil-fuel-related emissions and major reductions of other anthropogenic sources are needed to save millions of lives, restore aerosol-perturbed rainfall patterns, and limit global warming to 2 °C. © 2019 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Maintenance and rehabilitation as parts of pavement's life cycle become more important since it's an effort to restore the road condition as planned. This process will produce the emission of greenhouse gases that give an impact to the environment. The Live Cycle Assessment (LCA) was used to estimate the GHG's emissions. With LCA we could identify the unit process that will produce the GHG's emissions during maintenance and rehabilitation of road pavement. This research aimed to identify the unit processes of the maintenance and rehabilitation of rigid and flexible pavement and to analyse the amount of GHG emitted during this process. Four local roads in Indonesia were investigated as case studies. The result indicated the amount of energy of the unit processes as well as the GHG amount. This will lead to the identification of the hotspot of flexible and rigid pavement maintenance process. In rigid pavement maintenance activities, the hotspots included the asphalt transport process to asphalt mixing plant, cement transportation to the batching plant, and cement processing. Meanwhile, in flexible pavement maintenance activities, the hotspots were the asphalt transportation to asphalt mixing plant, transportation aggregate, and transportation to site. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Background: Rice can absorb less than 40% of applied nitrogen fertilizer, whereas the unabsorbed nitrogen fertilizer may cause environmental problems, such as algal blooms in freshwater and increased production of nitrous oxide, a greenhouse gas which is 300 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Development of nitrogen use efficient (NUE) rice is essential for more environmentally friendly rice production. Recently, NUE rice has been developed by root-specific expression of alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT) gene from barley, a monocot plant. Therefore, we tested the efficacy of AlaAT gene from cucumber in transgenic rice, aiming to provide evidence for the conservation of AlaAT gene function in monocot and dicot. Results: AlaAT gene from cucumber (CsAlaAT2) has been successfully cloned and constructed on pCAMBIA1300 plant expression vectors under the control of tissue-specific promoter OsAnt1. Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation of Indonesian rice cv. Fatmawati using this construct produced 14 transgenic events. Pre-screening of T1 seedlings grown in the agar medium containing low nitrogen concentration identified selected events that were superior in the root dry weight. Southern hybridization confirmed the integration of T-DNA in the selected event genomes, each of them carried 1, 2, or 3 T-DNA insertions. Efficacy assay of three lead events in the greenhouse showed that in general transgenic events had increased biomass, tiller number, nitrogen content, and grain yield compared to WT. One event, i.e., FAM13, showed an increase in yield as much as 27.9% and higher plant biomass as much as 27.4% compared to WT under the low nitrogen condition. The lead events also showed higher absorption NUE, agronomical NUE, and grain NUE as compared to WT under the low nitrogen condition. Conclusions: The results of this study showed that root-specific expression of cucumber alanine aminotransferase2 gene improved nitrogen use efficiency in transgenic rice, which indicate the conservation of function of this gene in monocot and dicot. © 2019, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Half of the world's sago production comes from Indonesia, and about 90% of Indonesia's sago originates from Papua, including West Papua. There are three types of technology used to produce sago starch in Indonesia, namely traditional, semi-mechanical and mechanical processes. In Papua generally the processing of sago starch is carried out with traditional processes. This study is intended to evaluate the environmental impacts caused by the traditionally processed sago starch products using the product life cycle (LCA) approach. Environmental impacts are estimated by analyzing the carbon footprint of GHG emissions resulting from 1 ton of dry sago starch. The scope of the product life cycle is limited to the stage of harvesting, transportation and extraction to produce dry sago starch. The results of the study show that the impact of GHG emissions generated to produce 1 ton of sago starch is 17.9 kgCO2eq. The biggest contribution came from the extraction process, especially from the drying process which was 12.25 kgCO2eq (68%). This value of impact is much lower when compared to corn starch (2700 kg CO2eq), potato starch (2402 kg CO2eq) and cassava starch (4310 kg CO2eq). This is mainly due to the low requirement of energy input of this traditional technology. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesia has voluntarily committed to mitigating climate change by reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent by 2020 and 41 percent by 2050. More than half of this reduction was originated from the forestry/peatlands sector. Avoiding peat fires is therefore crucial for Indonesia to meet its targets. However, the efforts have been hampered by the fact that a large area of peatland has been burnt. The estimated extent of peatland and mangrove burnt was 2,124,000 Ha during the forest fire in Indonesia in 1997/1998. In 1997-1998, high carbon emissions made Indonesia as one of the largest global polluters. The peat fire occurrence in Indonesia has caused severe problems from environmental, economic, health also mortality. Indonesia has the largest peatland area in the region, which is 20.6 million ha or 10.8% of the land area. These lands are spread across various islands, 7.2 million ha (35%) in the Sumatera island, 6.6 million ha (32%) in Kalimantan island, 0.6 million ha (3%) in Sulawesi island and around 6.2 million ha (30%) in Papua island. Peatland in the Sumatera island has suffered severe damage due to land clearing and burning. The objective of this research is to determine the characteristics of peatland in various land conditions, namely primary forest, ex-peatland fire, and community mix plantation as well as to learn the dynamics of peat groundwater level in each study location. Rainfall and groundwater level sensors installed in the primary forest, ex-peatland fire, and community mix plantation. Rainfall-groundwater level analysis conducted to understand the hydrological response in various peatland characteristics. The results showed that in the ex-peatland fire and mix plantation have changed the peat soil characteristics with an increase of soil bulk density. This indicates decreasing the infiltration capacity, soil porosity and increase the surface water in the peatland area. Increasing the groundwater level response to rainfall is stable in the natural peatland forest. This indicates the function of forest cover as rainfall interception and reduces the volume and lag time of rainwater before reaching the forest floor. Community plantation with low canopy diversity has lower forest cover function than in the natural peatland forest. This will increase the volume of rainwater in the peat soil and increase the rainfall-groundwater level response much higher than in the natural forest. Maintain the diversity of canopy cover and reduce the open peatland by fire will control the hydrological response in groundwater level dynamics. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesia has targeted 29 % Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction in 2030 and Industry is one of the big two contributors for GHG emissions. As an industry, mining is an energy-intensive industry, and reducing energy consumption is one of the strategies to improve mining environmental performance. The aim of this paper is to estimate the GHG emission reduction in a mining project through energy reduction initiatives. A copper mine in Indonesia with processing plant capacity of 120,000 t/d and operate 111 Caterpillar 793C Haul Truck was taken as a case study. This mine site has two sources of an electricity namely coal-fired power plant with 112 MW output and diesel power plant with 45 MW output. The analysis method for calculating CO2 emission is using IPCC method where fuel consumption and emission factor are two main variables for GHG emissions. Business as usual scenario (TIER 1) showed that the average of diesel fuel consumption for fleets operation generated 294,006 t CO2-eq/y. A coal-fired power plant with average coal consumption of 350 t/d/unit generated 1.15 Mt CO2-eq/y and diesel power plant consumed 4.35 ML/y produced 11,632 t CO2-eq/y. Two energy initiative programs were identified namely fuel conversion and used oil utilisation program. The initiative scenario focused on substituting, reducing and reusing of fossil fuels including coal, diesel fuel, and used oil. This scenario was estimated to contribute the carbon emission reduction (t CO2-eq) of 258,381 annually. The involvement of mining industry in carbon emission reduction is not only helping Indonesia in achieving its GHG emissions reduction target but also increases mine site environmental performance and company image.

	abstract = {Mineral and hydrocarbon extraction and infrastructure are increasingly significant drivers of forest loss, greenhouse gas emissions, and threats to the rights of forest communities in forested areas of Amazonia, Indonesia, and Mesoamerica. Projected investments in these sectors suggest that future threats to forests and rights are substantial, particularly because resource extraction and infrastructure reinforce each other and enable population movements and agricultural expansion further into the forest. In each region, governments have made framework policy commitments to national and cross-border infrastructure integration, increased energy production, and growth strategies based on further exploitation of natural resources. This reflects political settlements among national elites that endorse resource extraction as a pathway toward development. Regulations that protect forests, indigenous and rural peoples’ lands, and conservation areas are being rolled back or are under threat. Small-scale gold mining has intensified in specific locations and also has become a driver of deforestation and degradation. Forest dwellers’ perceptions of insecurity have increased, as have documented homicides of environmental activists. To explain the relationships among extraction, infrastructure, and forests, this paper combines a geospatial analysis of forest loss overlapped with areas of potential resource extraction, interviews with key informants, and feedback from stakeholder workshops. The increasing significance of resource extraction and associated infrastructure as drivers of forest loss and rights violations merits greater attention in the empirical analyses and conceptual frameworks of Sustainability Science. © 2018 National Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Rising environmental concerns on climate changes are causing an increasing attention on reducing wastes dumped to the landfills. As Indonesia's marine fishery industry is in developing stage in its capacity and production systems which consequently increases generation of wastes. Approximately 25-35% of fish production will ultimately become residue or waste due to the unsophisticated technology of fish storage and processing facilities. Most of their wastes dumped in landfills which subsequently impact the environment. Waste minimization program like upcycling waste into the more useful product can be an option for not only dumping wastes dumped into the landfill but also subsequently reducing greenhouse gas emissions such as CO2 and methane. This study evaluated the biological and chemical processes of fish silage production using various additives, including molasses as a carbon source and formic acid. Experiments were conducted in five anaerobic reactors containing 10 kg of fish waste each; the observation period was 40 days. The results indicated that adding molasses (10%, 15%, and 20% in volume) and Lactobacillus plantarum to fish waste significantly influenced pH and water/ash content. On average, the silage process reduced around 38% of fish wastes dumped in a landfill. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {                             This paper discusses energy audit in operating oil and gas production facility in Indonesia by taking a case study at Field Y, East Kalimantan. Energy audit is essential to be carried out in order to identify current rate of efficiency and energy intensity in oil and gas production facility, and extrapolate the data as baseline to recommend potential room for improvement in increasing efficiency. Calculation on efficiency and energy intensity has been performed against main equipments which consumes fuel gas, namely generators and turbo compressors. Data from 2015-2017 were collected to perform the calculation. Calculation results showed that generator thermal efficiency ranges from 13.54% - 17.45%, which was affected by generator load power itself. The efficiency improves as the load power increases. Meanwhile, compressor thermal efficiency ranged from 28.36% - 33.79% depending on process variables and compressed gas volume. Energy intensity calculation result showed the value of 64.554 - 71.064 and greenhouse gas emission ranged from 160.48-208.17 kt CO                             2                              eq. From this study, it is identified that improvements to increase efficiency and reduce energy intensity can be made through operating one generator and one compressor, and assessing the use of renewable energy resources to supply power requirement for non-process facilities on site.                          © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

	abstract = {The vast area of oil palm plantations makes Indonesia the largest producer of palm oil in the world. Thus, it has the potential to be a source of biomass waste, especially empty fruit bunches. Biomass waste is the fourth largest energy source after coal, petroleum and natural gases so it can contribute more to the supply of renewable and sustainable energy sources. The utilization of this waste can be done by conversion through a thermochemical process, namely by pyrolysis. The conversion process produces emissions that have an impact on the environment. Emissions generated in this process are in the form of greenhouse gas emissions and air pollutant gases. This study identifies the impact of these emissions by using the Life Cycle Assessment (LCA). The LCA method was used in this study to assess the environmental impact associated with the use of empty fruit bunches with the help of Simapro 8.5 software. The stages of LCA are goals and scope, life cycle inventory, life cycle impact assessment, and data interpretation. By using SimaPro 8.5, the value of the magnitude of each environmental impact will be known. The results showed that the utilization of empty fruit bunches by fast pyrolysis has the potential environmental impacts of 0.02149 kg SO2eq as the causes of acidification; 0.00399 kg PO4eq causes of Eutrophication; 586 kg CO2eq causes of global warming (GWP100a), and 595 kg C2H4eq causes photochemical oxidation. © 2019 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Indonesia's economy relies heavily on the land-based sector, which results in high deforestation and forest degradation that leads to large emissions from Land Use Change and Forestry (LUCF). Under its Nationally Determined Contributions, Indonesia has committed to achieving emission reductions of 29% by 2030 as compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario. However, as the largest share comes from LUCF, mitigation efforts in this sector will reduce its production. This study assesses the potential impact of the implementation of the mitigation efforts in the LUCF sector on the economy and environment through the use of a computable general equilibrium model. Two main approaches were introduced to reduce emissions: 1) increasing the crop yield (intensification), which is expected to motivate farmers to use less land and thus, lead to a decrease in deforestation; and 2) encouraging land conservation. Our simulation indicated that intensification alone results in less GDP loss but does not significantly reduce deforestation and emissions from LUCF as farmers will still cultivate the land as usual, and land expansion for commercial plantations, especially palm oil, will continue. Therefore, introducing conservation practices, though costly, may help to protect forest areas and reduce emissions from LUCF. Thus, the simultaneous implementation of intensification and conservation efforts is recommended. To this end, cooperation between the central and regional governments is necessary along with an incentive scheme that encourages farmers to adopt mitigation efforts on their lands. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

Renewable energy sources presents a clean way to produce electricity. However, the intermittency nature of renewable energy sources causes unstable energy production.

This paper presents a concept of power to gas energy storage system that is coupled with a chemical looping combustion power generation to provide base load power from the unused electricity in the grid based on a real case of Indonesia. Enhanced process integration is employed in order to achieve an optimal heat and exergy recovery.

	abstract = {The Government of Indonesia is accelerating the use of new and renewable energy for electricity supply. The use of renewable energy also intends to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Electricity generated will be connected in a transmission and distribution network on the grid that is available to be distributed to consumers. Renewable energy sources, especially the Mini Hydro Power Plant (MHPP) with a capacity of 1 - 10 MW, are located in rural areas far from the load center. Long distances will result in reduced voltage and power losses in the power distribution system. Therefore the connection of renewable energy plants especially MHPP should not have a negative impact on the existing electricity system. In general, the connection is declared successful if the voltage drop is in the range between a maximum of +5% and a minimum of -10% of nominal voltage, small power losses, and short circuit current is not large. The MHPP connection must be carried out with a technical and economic approach when making decisions on determining the connection point. Because sometimes the decision to choose a connection location is technically fulfilling but economically it does not meet, on the contrary, there is also technically not good even though it is economically feasible, or both are not feasible. As shown in the decision making for the Bontosalama MHPP which is directly connected to the Sinjai substation although investment is expensive it is not constrained from the technical limitations of the Sinjai system. © 2020 Wydawnictwo SIGMA-NOT.

Consequently, specific management strategies should be applied to reduce the emission and to serve future generations. Also, mitigation of climate change in the peatlands agriculture should also be given priority. This paper explores the existing farming action on climate change mitigation, and strategies of degraded peatlands management to mitigate climate change in term of reducing GHG emission. Existing condition of mitigation action by farmers in their farming systems; rice, rubber and oil palm, were reviewed through a farm household survey. Then, development strategies for climate change mitigation through sustainable degraded peatlands management were discussed through Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and in-depth interview with experts from concerned research institutions and universities through morphological analysis. The finding of this research shows that farmer’s existing climate change mitigation actions pertain to land preparation, water management, and soil management in their farming system. Moreover, specific actions and strategies to mitigate climate change in the sustainable degraded peatlands management which were determined based on the most relevant variables under a given future condition consist of constructing canal blocking system, introducing technology for water and soil management, revitalizing agricultural extension institution as well as establishing fire brigade and improving farmer experience and knowledge on climate change. © 2019 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The degradation of tropical forests in Indonesia is perceived to be an essential contributor to land-based greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in addition to deforestation. However, the impacts of forest degradation are currently understudied and poorly understood, in comparison to deforestation, which is easier to be detected and thus more ready to be quantified and monitored. In order to understand better the contributing factors of Indonesia's GHG emissions profiles from the forestry sector as well as taking the opportunity to tackle climate change, improving knowledge on GHG emissions from forest degradation is essential. Both literature review and simulation using a carbon accounting model were used in the analysis. National emissions profile of Indonesia has been reported to the UNFCCC, in which forest degradation has been one of the sources of emissions, although its emission value tended to be underestimated and may contain high uncertainty. It is because logging and fires in secondary forests have not been fully captured as sources of emissions, as well as post-disturbance growth that potentially enhance forest carbon stocks. This study clearly shows the importance of calculating GHG emissions from forest degradation caused by anthropogenic activities (logging, fires). It is suggested that accuracy can be improved by using a system approach that occurs in the ecosystem carbon cycle through modeling that can capture the flow of carbon following the disturbance events. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Driven by increased global demand for vegetable oil in the food and biofuel sectors, oil palm plantations based on monoculture technology have expanded into lowland tropical forests. Interest in diversified, mixed oil palm systems is increasing as these might increase efficiency of the use of land and other resources, reduce farmer risk, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions per unit product. Land Equivalent Ratio for provisioning services (LERP) values above 1.0 show that at least some diversified systems use land more efficiently than monocultures and are thus “land sparing,” where monoculture LERP cannot exceed 1.0. Diversification also modifies climate and water regulating functions (“land sharing”) relative to a forest reference, as indicated in the LERR index. A “multifunctional” LERM indicator combines both; land sparing plus land sharing effects jointly determine expected regulating services. Empirical assessment of multiple ecosystem services in agricultural landscapes is assisted by models that synthesise process-based knowledge, especially for perennial systems where well-designed experiments require a full production cycle, and are costly and scarce. Agroforestry models explore spacing, intercropping and soil management options, predicting harvestable yields, impacts on water flows, nutrient leaching, and greenhouse gas emissions. We used the process-based Water, Nutrient and Light Capture in Agroforestry System (WaNuLCAS) model to explore mixed oil palm + cocoa and oil palm + pepper intercrop systems with modified (“double row”) planting patterns for Indonesian contexts and estimated consequences for the carbon footprint. The oil palm + cocoa intercrop provided a high LERP (1.4), while also replenishing more ground water and having a lower C footprint. This combination also has a return to labour equal to that in oil palm monocultures and a higher benefit cost ratio than the oil palm + pepper combination that maximizes Net Present Value. Oil palm + cocoa systems are also less sensitive to price uncertainty for oil palm, and buffer for oil palm and cocoa production risks, assumed to be independent of each other. Considerable economic and environmental system improvements appear to be feasible through mixed oil palm systems and diversification as a pathway to intensification deserves full attention of research and policy development. © Copyright © 2020 Khasanah, van Noordwijk, Slingerland, Sofiyudin, Stomph, Migeon and Hairiah.},

	abstract = {The combination of rapid urbanization and industrialization expansion increased waste volumes. Most of the wastewaters generated from either domestic or industrial sources are still discharged without adequate treatment processes, and impact on the environment and public health. The objective of this paper was to provide a comprehensive literature review on the application of horizontal subsurface flow constructed wetlands in treating a variety of wastewaters, discussing its feasibility in pollutant removal efficiency and additional benefit in climate change mitigation through carbon sequestration. The following results were obtained: 98%, 96%, 85%, 90%, 92%, 88% for BOD5, COD, TSS, TN, NH4 –N, PO43-respectively in Kenya; 98.46% and 98.55% for COD and BOD5 in Indonesia; and ranges from 94-99.9%, 91.7-97.9% and 99.99% for BOD5, COD and TFC respectively in Costa Rica. Whereas in Ethiopia, the HSSFCW achieved the following abatement efficiencies: COD ranges from 58 to 80%, BOD ranges from 66 to 77%, TKN ranges from 46-61%, sulfates ranges from 53 to 82%, and NH4 – N range from 64 to 82.5% for tannery wastewater treatment. For domestic wastewater treatment; 99.3%, 89%, 855, 84.05%, 77.3%, 99% and 94.5% were achieved for BOD5, COD, TSS, TN, PO4 3-, TP, Sulfate, and TFC, respectively. In addition to improving water quality, CWs have a CSP. For example, CWs showed CO2 equivalent of 4119.54 g C/m2/yr CSP (carbon sequestration potential) which is 15118.7118 g CO2. The methane equivalent to this amount of carbon sequestration is 604.748472 g/m2/yr. Generally, research results indicated that constructed wetlands are efficient wastewater treatment techniques and should be encouraged for wastewater management as a strategy to reduce wastewater pollution. However, constructed wetland performance efficiency sustainability is affected by the operational conditions of HSSFCW including plant species, media/substrate types, water depth, hydraulic loading, and hydraulic retention time and feeding mode. © 2020, ALÖKI Kft., Budapest, Hungary.},

	abstract = {In 2013 Indonesia produced about 28 million ton/year of CPO. This large CPO production has an impact on liquid waste called as Palm Oil Mill Effluent (POME) and Empty Fruit Bunches (EFB). About 80 million ton of POME and 32 million tons of EFB are produced per year. Open anaerobic pond (conventional treatment) is widely used to reduce COD and BOD content from POME emits uncontrolled CO2 and CH4, which are the main greenhouse gasses and harmful for the environment. POME has high content of COD (50000-100000 mg/L) and BOD (25, 000 mg/L) and this is a potential for biogas production. Due to the C/N ratio of POME (6.5) is far below optimal C/N ratio for biogas production using anaerobic digester (between 20 and 30), combining high C/N ratio (60) EFB with POME is predicted to improve the biogas production. The effluent of anaerobic digester containing rich nutrients such as Nitrogen, Phosphor and Kalium are potential for plant or microalgae growth. This experiment used two types of reactor, which are batchly operated in the room condition: (i) a 13L-UASB (Up-flow Anaerobic Sludge Blanket) reactor made of PVC and (ii) 1.5L tube reactors made of PET (Poly Ethylene Terephthalate) plastic. Adding EFB into POME was proven to increase biogas production. The results indicate that the higher EFB composition the faster the biogas formation is. Based on this result, the conversion factor (volume base) of the mixture of POME and EFB into biogas is range from 13 to 47 %. The highest conversion is 47 % from ratio 7.5 of POME to 1 EFB. Based on this result it can be concluded that ratio 7.5 of POME to 1 EFB generated high volume of biogas and methane content. This research also shows significant increase in biomass production of spirulina when biogas was fed into POME medium. Total produced biomass on POME medium with biogas is double than that on POME medium without biogas. This increase could be due utilization of CO2 content in the biogas as a carbon source by Spirulina sp. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

An extended version of the DEA method allowed us to evaluate not only technicalities, but also price efficiency of budget support for natural gas production in the considered countries. The data for the empirical model characterizing the volume of financial support to oil producers through budgetary transfers and tax expenditures was taken from the OECD statistical base. The obtained results indicate low efficiency of state support for coal and lignite production in Russia, the industry that is responsible for the largest generation and emission of greenhouse gases. In accordance with international obligations, Russia should solve this problem. To achieve this goal, the government should legislatively limit the funding of coal projects and exclude coal projects from the sphere of credit and export agencies, development banks, and state banks. © 2020, Econjournals.

	abstract = {Forest and land fires are among the major catastrophic events that occur in Indonesia. They are a major cause of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. Their multiple sources are most diverse and root in nature and society. The immediate fire effects directly and the long-term landscape ecosystem degradations indirectly cause major and persisting and serious problems of public health and ecosystem service. Smoke haze from the forest and land fires in Sumatra and Kalimantan in 2015 caused significant environmental and economic losses in Indonesia, Singapore and Malaysia. We describe the different types of land uses and land cover where fires and smoke haze took place, and how local politics have affected fire use from 2001 to 2017. We calculated hot spots from satellite imageries as proxies for fire occurrences and applied regression analysis to understand the link between fire and local politics in Sumatra and Kalimantan. The results show that the greatest frequency of hot spots occurred in wood and oil palm plantations and logging concessions (47%), followed by conservation areas (31%) and community land (22%). Local elections involve land transactions, and fires were used as a cheap way to increase the land value. The use of fire as means of land clearing was strongly influenced by local politics. Their frequency and abundance obviously increased about a year prior to local elections. The reasons behind the correlation need to be understood so that appropriate incentives and sanctions can be put in place and deter political leaders from using fire as an incentive to their advantage. © 2019 Commonwealth Forestry Association.

	abstract = {The challenge for nutrition science is to understand strategies to enable a balance between healthy diets and sustainable food systems. This study was to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emission of food consumption related to different dietary preferences among Indonesian adults by body mass index (BMI). Methods: We utilized the existing food consumption survey databases. Dietary and anthropometric information were obtained from Total Diet Study (Studi Diet Total/SDT) in 2014 and Basic Health Research (Riskesdas/ RKD) in 2013. The most consumed food items from 14 food groups were selected as representatives of rice, cassava, tofu, long beans, banana, chicken meat, chicken liver, mackerel tuna, chicken egg, condensed milk, palm oil, white sugar, shallot, and ground coffee. The GHGs emission factors were acquired from Thai National Life Cycle Inventory Database. Food weight (gram), energy intake (kcal), and GHGs emission (kgCO2eq) from consumption of these food items were analyzed among BMI groups. Results: Annual GHGs emission by underweight, normal, overweight and obesity group were 794, 827, 801, and 791 kgCO2eq/ person, respectively. The highest contributor of GHG was chicken meat, followed by rice and chicken eggs (190, 175, and 123 kgCO2eq/person/y, respectively). Indonesian people in the obesity group consumed higher amount of food (p50.001) than other groups, however, they emitted lowest GHG emission (p50.001). Conclusion: This finding suggested that selection of food type plays a critical role on the environment and amount of consumption. Food choices of the population may ultimately result in impacts on environment and have public health consequences. © 2020, Center for Academic Publications Japan. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {This paper presents an assessment of the outcomes of research carried out under the Sustainable Wetlands Adaptation and Mitigation Programme (SWAMP). SWAMP aimed to inform national and international climate policy and practice by developing tools and methods to quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, carbon stocks and flux in tropical wetlands due to land use, land-use change and forestry (LULUCF). This assessment modelled SWAMP's intended outcomes as a theory of change (ToC) and used qualitative methods to test the ToC and to evaluate whether and how the outcomes were achieved. It found that SWAMP research has helped raise academic and policy interest in wetlands, mangroves and peat forests as carbon reservoirs, and that SWAMP's recommendations informed policy discourse and supported the development of technical guidance and strategies of sustainable wetland management. However, the research had a weak effect on international and Indonesian climate change policies compared to other factors. The Paris Agreement and Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) do not include the quantification of carbon stocks from mangroves, which are not all located in the forest areas. Knowledge translation was achieved through a variety of mechanisms, with direct engagement identified as particularly important. The outcome evaluation approach proved useful as a way of conceptualising and organising the analysis of research impact on development outcomes. © 2018 BioOne. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The area of Indonesian rice fields in 2016 reached 8.19 million hectares (ha), an increase of 1.16% from the previous year, this number comprising 4.78 million ha of irrigated rice fields and 3.4 million ha of non-irrigated rice fields. In 2017, especially in East Java, the harvest area is 2,278,460 hectares, and rice production is 13,633,701 tons. On the other hand, increasing agricultural activities can also contribute to emissions that can trigger climate change through the greenhouse gases (GHG) produced. GHG is a gas contained in the atmosphere, which absorbs and re-emits infrared radiation. Side effects of greenhouse gas accumulation can cause extreme climate change that affects land productivity. This study aims to analyze rice field productivity and build a greenhouse gas emission model that produce from the rice field productivity system. Emissions to be discussed in this study are CO2, CH4, and N2O. The approach is carried out with a system dynamics because it has the characteristics of a complex, nonlinear system dynamics, changes in system behavior over time and feedback that describes new information about the state of the rice productivity system, which will then produce further decisions. The results of this study are causal loop diagram of CH4, CO2 and N2O emissions resulting from the productivity of rice fields modeled using system dynamics. This model contains GHG information generated from the agricultural sector and its impact. This model can be used as a consideration for the government and stakeholders as a reference for making policies for GHG emission mitigation technology as part of smart agriculture. © 2019 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Although common in developed countries such as Japan and Taiwan, the use of lamps coupled with motion sensors are still uncommon and even rare in Indonesia. Our experiment aims to show that simple installation of commercially available motion sensors can contribute to reduce the electricity bill from the increase of energy efficiency, abundance in availability of energy being the main factor in Indonesian high energy consumption habits. High electricity demand for consumption at current supply level in Indonesia led to the rising cost of electricity bills. This factor is compounded by the fact that many electric generators in Indonesia still use fossil fuels, which contributes to the high basic generation cost. UBL is one of the universities that aim to be a green campus. Our research explores the possibility of installing motion sensors to contribute to the energy efficiency. Although mostly common in developed countries, the use of motion sensors for energy efficiency is still rare, especially in Indonesia. Despite rising cost and supply shortages, Indonesian buildings are still of high energy consumption. Our experiment shows that simple installation of commercially available motion sensors can contribute to reduce the electricity bill from the increase of energy efficiency. One of the efforts to lower energy demand on the consumer side is to use the electricity efficiently, such as turning off lights in a room when it is not in use. This method can be simply done by turning the light switches for office and classrooms, but difficult to do in public spaces such as toilets and corridors. Automatic light switches experimentally installed in sample toilet rooms prove that electricity consumption from the lamps can contribute to the reduction of total weekly energy that translates into Greenhouse Gas emission reduction. © 2018 by the authors.

This research employed time-series data of 1987-2016 periods at selected province in Indonesia (East Java). Agricultural sector's externalities were addressed by environmental degradation variables (greenhouse gas emissions) and environmental carrying capacity variable. The 2006 IPCC guidelines for green house gas inventories tier 1 and land balance approach was utilized to calculate those externalities. Furthermore, for generating a model of proper strategies, the second law of thermodynamics was applied through a simultaneous equation model that was analyzed with Two-Stage Least Square method. This research revealed that agricultural income, environmental degradation, and environmental capacity have simultaneously significant interrelationship. Intensifying credit allocation for rural farm household and adding direct investment in the agriculture sector can decrease environmental degradation, escalate environmental carrying capacity, and increase agricultural income. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

In this study, data for the rice production of 34 provinces in Indonesia at year of 2015 were gathered from the Indonesian statistical data on area cultivation, productivity, fertilizer application, diesel, and irrigated water. The CF of indirect and direct carbon emissions which were correlated with those agricultural intakes was calculated with reported emission factors. The result demonstrated the CFs mean in 34 provinces during dry and rainy season in Indonesia was 1,900,341.48 kg CO eq/ha and 1,892,825.68 kg CO eq/ha, respectively. The data also showed that the highest of CF production during dry and rainy seasons obtained by Belitung Islands and East Nusa Tenggara province, respectively. Meanwhile the lowest of CF production for both dry and rainy season belonged to Yogyakarta province. Result on the quantified agricultural intakes demonstrated the irrigation water usage, fertilizer usage, direct methane and diesel for agricultural tools, had biggest to lowest contribution to CF production, respectively. Based on the result, we concluded that a rice cultivation practices which has an efficient irrigation water usage may become an option to reduce CF that leads to climate change mitigation. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {The use of renewable energy sources made from wood biomass processed in the form of wood pellets is needed to anticipate the decreasing of fossil energy (petroleum and coal). The wood biomass utilization is not only environmentally friendly and more sustainable, but also can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and environmental pollution, especially when used as power source for electricity generator. Compared to other countries, Indonesia has the potential as a major producer because it's vast amount of forest and biodiversity that can be used as source of raw materials for wood pellets. With 2.44 million hectares forest area (including 1.22 million hectares of Teak plantation), Perum Perhutani has opportunity to develop energy wood. Large potential source is JPP (Jati Plus Perhutani) Teak wood harvested from first thinning (5 years old) and partly from second thinning (10 years old) which still inadequate for sawn timber. The aim of this study was to determine the characteristics of wood pellet from 5 years old JPP teak (Tectona grandis L.f.) as energy sources. Characteristics of wood pellet including the value of water content, calorific value, fly ash, ash content, density and sulfur content compared to the SNI 8021: 2014 quality standard. This research used CRD (Complete Random Desaign). The treatments on wood pellet making were of three different temperatures (175C, 200C and 225C) applied at 2 timings (3 and 5 minutes). Samples of 5 years old JPP teak wood were obtained from KPH Cepu. The characteristics of JPP Teak wood pellets tested at the Laboratory of Timber Chemicals, Energy and NTFPs at the Forest Products Research and Development Center Bogor. Characteristics of JPP Teak wood pellets compared to national quality standards (SNI 8021: 2014) were water content (0.78 to 2.64%; max 10%), calorific value (4, 399 to 4, 585 Kcal/Kg; min 4, 000 Kcal/Kg), density (0.63 to 0.92 gr/cm3; min 0.8 gr/cm3), fly ash level (77.68 to 79.01%; max 80%), carbon content (17.16 up to 18.16%, min 14%), ash content (3.63 to 4.56%; max 1.2%) and sulfur content (0.01 to 0.02%; max 0.05%). The higher pressing temperature and time, tend to decreasing water content, sulfur content and fly ash content and increasing density and carbon content. The conclusion of this study was that 5-year-old JPP Teak wood can be used as raw material for making Wood Pellets which can meet national quality standards (SNI 8021: 2014) except for the ash content. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The research aimed to find out and analyze the dynamics of CH4 emission in each stage of rice growth, seasonal CH4 emission, and rice productivity cultivated both organically and conventionally on Alfisols and Andisols at Karanganyar Regency, Indonesia. All treatments were conducted by local farmers with common agricultural practices. In conventional farming, for Andisols only fertilizer has applied the chemical whereas for Alfisols the chemical fertilizer was applied with the addition of fresh chicken manure. The sampling of CH4 gas conducted four times in each location at 15, 35, 65, and 100 days after planting (DAP), respectively, using box chambers (50×50×100 cm). The gases were analyzed using gas chromatography, while productivity was determined by calculating total yield 2.5 m-2 (Indonesian Statistical Bureau). The treatment of Andisols C (Andisols with Conventional Farming Management) resulted in the highest CH4 emission in paddy fields for one planting season. The highest CH4 emissions were obtained at the active tillering phase (35 DAP), because of the effect of flooded conditions. For both andisols and alfisols conventional farming management resulted in higher rice productivity, whereas organic farming management resulted in better economically and in preserving the environment. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {In order to produce goods and services that are consumed in Sweden, natural resources are extracted and pollutants are emitted in many other countries. This paper presents an analysis of the goods and services consumed in Sweden that cause the largest environmental pressures in terms of resource use and emissions, identifying in which countries or regions these pressures occur. The results have been calculated using a hybrid model developed in the PRINCE project combining the multi-regional input-output database EXIOBASE with data from the Swedish economic and environmental accounts. The following environmental pressures are analysed: Use of Land, Water and Material resources, Emissions of Greenhouse gases (GHG), Sulphur dioxides (SO2), Nitrogen oxides (NOx), and Particulate Matters (PM 2.5 and 10). The product groups are those goods and services bought for private or public consumption and capital investments, as listed in the Swedish economic accounts. The results show that Sweden is a net importer of all embodied environmental pressures, except for land use and material use. The most important product groups across environmental pressures are construction, food products and direct emissions from households (except for sulphur dioxide emissions and material use for the latter). Other product groups that are found to have environmental pressures across several indicators are wholesale and retail services, architecture and engineering, dwellings, motor vehicles and machinery and equipment. However, for the three natural resource pressures Use of Water, Land and Material resources, agricultural products are a relatively important product group along with products from forestry for the last two indicators. A considerable proportion of the environmental pressure occurs in Sweden, but when comparing those of domestic origin and that occurring internationally, the majority of all pressures for Swedish consumption occur abroad (except for land use). Other countries stand out as particularly important as origins of pressure for Swedish consumption, most notably China, which is among the top five countries for emissions to air, as well as blue water and material use. Other highly relevant countries or regions are Rest of Asia and Pacific (i.e. Asia and Pacific except Indonesia, Taiwan, Australia, India, South Korea, China and Japan), Russia, Germany as well as Denmark and Spain for certain product groups and environmental pressure combinations. This pattern of geographically spread pressures caused by Swedish consumption indicates the need for addressing the pressures at various levels of collaboration: national, within the European Union, bilateral and international. © 2019},

The result indicates that on average, the total number of companies disclose their GHG emission disclosure is increased from 30% in 2015 to 32% in 2017, even though the disclosure of GHG emissions is still relatively low. On average, in this study, companies as a sample are in a "blue" rating of PROPER rating (which have value 3 out of 4). The most disclosed item by companies is external verification with 92% in 3 years. The results point out that profitability, PROPER rating, and institutional ownership positively affect the GHG emission disclosure.

The actions to mitigate these emissions and maintain yield have being a serious concern. This study aims to investigate the emission of CH4 and N2O and determine the limiting factors of CH4 and N2O emission due to water regime and organic matter (OM) amendment in inceptisol soil. Treatments consist of two factors, the first factor was water regime, e.g., 1) continuously flooded, and 2) Alternate wetting-drying (AWD). The second factor was organic matter amendment, e.g., 1) with OM 3 t ha-1, and 2) without OM. The results showed that the addition of organic matter to the soils alongside managing its water regime with AWD resulted in low daily CH4 emissions compare to continuous flooded. No significant difference (p<0.05) in daily N2O emission between AWD and continuous flooded. The dynamic of C-org, Eh, Fe2O3, MnO2 in the soil due to water regime were affected daily CH4 emissions, while pH, NO3 and NH4 were affected daily N2O emissions. Results of this study can be used for further research and development of a model on CH4 emission from rice fields to determine feasible soil management in GHG mitigation. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

Data were derived from primary and secondary sources which are conducted in the period of October - December 2018. The result shows that there were several factors from the content and context of policy that have a significant correlation in the renewable energy policy implementation. The political environment has a role in the implementation of policy content related to the benefits that will be perceived by the community.

	abstract = {Analysis of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions has been studied in modern and traditional tempeh industries in Indonesia. Rumah Tempe Indonesia (RTI), a modern tempeh industry, has unique process production compared to other traditional industries such as in Kedaung, South Tangerang, Indonesia, and has used modern equipment for processing tempeh. These characteristics affect the total of GHG emissions resulted in tempeh produced by RTI. The purpose of this study is to compare the total of GHG emissions resulted from tempeh production in RTI and traditional industry in Kedaung. Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a tool used to estimate environmental impacts of a product or process. In our study we use an LCA method CML-IA baseline V3.01/World 2000 implemented in PC-tool SimaPro 8.0.1 (Pre 2016). The analysis result of GHG emissions impact represents that tempeh produced by traditional industry in Kedaung has lower GHG emissions than RTI does. We obtain that the total GHG emissions produced by tempeh in Kedaung and RTI are about 0.296 and 0.676 kg CO2 eq/kg tempeh, respectively. This result may indicate that the traditional industry, which uses electrical energy for the boiling and splitting processes, produces lower GHG emissions than modern industry, which needs more electrical energy consumption for whole of process production. The largest CO2 emissions in tempeh produced by Kedaung is generated from the tempeh processing, which reaches 98.17% of the total GHG emissions and the remaining substances are generated from electricity. We found that at RTI the tempeh processing also contributes 69.19 % for the total GHG emissions, while the rest come from untreated wastewater. © 2018 Author(s).},

	abstract = {Land reclamation activities can, directly and indirectly, impact the environment. Examples of direct effects include alterations in coastal geomorphology, variations in the chemical content of water and changes in biological composition along the littoral zone. The indirect impacts can involve geological changes and increase vulnerability to natural disasters. Reclamation processes also result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from vehicle and machinery fuel use and through the release of carbon stored in vegetation, soils and sediment in mangroves and seagrass ecosystems. Considering the global extent of land reclamation, the scale of these emissions is likely to be of widespread interest. The case of Jakarta Bay provides useful insights that can contribute to the improved environmental management of kindred land development projects in Indonesia and other parts of Asia. More than 5,100 ha of new land mass is planned from the Jakarta Bay reclamation. Preliminary analysis suggests that 30% of the planned area will require more than 150.7 million cubic metres of sand sourced from 8,628 ha of marine quarry area. In this study, we examine the sources of GHG emissions in these activities and the potential opportunities available to reduce them. The audience for this paper includes policymakers, environmental practitioners, city developers and postgraduate scholars dealing with land reclamation or other major infrastructure developments. © 2018 by the Regents of the University of California.},

	abstract = {Almost every waste management step generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; hence, it is imperative to design appropriate treatment methods from sources to disposal sites for reducing their environmental impact. In this study, to provide guidelines for developing a suitable waste management strategy for Depok, Indonesia, emissions from four waste management scenarios for the city are calculated. These scenarios involve treatments such as the application of Waste Treatment Unit (WTU), incinerator, anaerobic digester, composting, and landfill. The best scenario affords the treatment of 150 tons/day of municipal solid waste (MSW) via composting, 80 tons via WTU, and 500 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 390 tons/day, which are sent to a controlled landfill in Depok. This best scenario generates net GHG emissions of 202,800 kg CO2-eq/day, accounting for 1900 kg CO2-eq/day from transportation; 4 kg CO2-eq/day from WTU; 25,700 kg CO2-eq/day from composting; 46,200 kg CO2-eq/day from anaerobic digestion; and 129,000 kg CO2-eq/day from a controlled landfill. By contrast, the worst scenario corresponds to the city's current waste management approach, producing net GHG emissions of 299,602.6 kg CO2-eq/day from the treatment of 600 tons/day of MSW via landfill, 70 tons/day via open burning, 60 tons/day via MRF, 340 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 40 tons/day via composting. © 2020 The Authors},

	abstract = {Natural Rubber is an important commodity for the world due to its valuable properties such as good elasticity and renewable. Natural rubber is used to produce various important products such as tire, sport equipment, and medical devices. With increasing demand for these products, the demand of natural rubber is projected to jump in the future. To fulfil this demand, the increasing of natural rubber production is unavoidable. However, to use natural rubber in producing those final products, it needs to flow through primary processing such as crumb rubber manufacturing process, crepe rubber processing and latex centrifuge processing. These processes become source of income for countries such as Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand as well as citizen of those countries. Despite of these positive impacts, the environmental impacts of natural rubber primary processing such as greenhouse gas emission, waste, high water and energy consumption are identified. Thus, to maintain sustainability, monitoring of sustainability impacts from natural rubber primary processing is necessary. Sustainability assessment is a procedure to evaluate sustainability impacts of products, process and policies. This paper aims to review sustainability assessment process applied in Natural Rubber Primary Processing. © 2019 IOP Publishing Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper aims to provide information on the efficiency of timber harvesting and residual stand damage caused by harvesting activities in natural forests. The results showed that: 1) Efficiency of harvesting natural forest timber ranged from 75-86% with an average of 80.6% before applying the low impact (RIL) and varied from 82-95% with an average of 87.6% for the RIL techniques; 2). Damage to residual stands due to logging of non-RIL and RIL ranged from 27.76-40.71% with an average of 31.97% and 5-40% with an average of 22.20%, respectively; 3). The application of RIL techniques and the existence of sustainable forest management certification could improve the efficiency of timber utilization. © 2019 Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

The National Action Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reductions was Indonesia's first comprehensive plan. It reflected Indonesia's emission reduction commitments to 2020, and the first phase ran from 2010 to 2014. This research evaluates its design and implementation. It assesses seven out of thirteen actions that were implemented to reduce emissions from forestry and peatland degradation. It is shown that only two actions had a direct, evidence-based link to emission sources. Three actions had some evidence of a link, albeit dependent on many factors. For the remaining two actions, focused on emissions from agriculture in peatland, there was no information to demonstrate clear and targeted implementation of the actions. The analysis also shows that the indicators listed in the National Action Plan were insufficient to demonstrate meaningful reductions of emissions. Part of the explanation for the problematic design of the actions is that many of them were pre-existing policies, aimed at achieving a variety of different objectives that were just rebadged as climate change actions. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.},

From 2014 to 2016, CO2 concentration in Indonesia showed a trend of increase, which is consistent with the global increase reported by the Greenhouse Gases Observing Satellite (GOSAT) Project. As an archipelago country, the results indicate that SST has a direct effect on the CO2 concentration in Indonesia. Their changing exhibits similar fluctuations; meanwhile, CO2 concentration and SST also presented positive correlation. In 2015, the number of fire hotspots suddenly increased to 140,699, because of occurrence of the worst forest fire. Due to special geographic conditions, forest fires did not induce CO2 concentration changes in Indonesia, but CO2 concentration in the corresponding islands showed a trend of increase. CO2 concentration increased in Kalimantan during the occurrence of forest fire in September–October 2014, and CO2 concentration increased in Kalimantan and Sumatra during the occurrence of forest fire in September–October 2015. Vegetation indices were stable and presented no correlation with CO2 concentration. This study demonstrated that OCO-2 is capable of monitoring CO2 concentration at a regional scale; additionally, an effective method for using OCO-2 Level 2 products is proposed. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Timber harvest from tropical regions generates seven billion dollars annually in exports and is estimated to occur across 20% of the area of remaining tropical forests. This timber harvesting is estimated to account for more than one in eight of all greenhouse gas emissions from tropical forests. Yet there is currently no means to independently estimate extracted volumes and associated greenhouse gas emissions. In this study, we built upon an earlier paper that used an automated algorithm applied to LiDAR to accurately identify area of timber harvest impact in the categories of roads/decks, skid trails and gaps. This algorithm was applied to 2014 harvest areas in four concessions in Kalimantan, Indonesia. In two of these concessions, total harvested timber volumes and greenhouse gas emissions were measured and calculated in the field using data from 188 harvested and extracted trees. In order to relate remote sensing data with the estimated extracted volumes, we calculated factors that linked extracted timber volumes with greenhouse gas emissions, and applied three different regression equations. The parameters of the most accurate equation were the areas of roads, skid trails and gaps, explaining 87% of the variation in the data. For situations where rivers are used in place of roads for extracting timber and for instances of non-mechanized, often illegal logging, a second equation was created in which only skid trail and gap attribute data were used, and in this equation 86% of the variation was accounted. The final equation, intended for use in scenarios where LiDAR data are not available but moderate resolution imagery could be used, associated length of roads only with extracted volumes. In this case, 78% of the variation was explained. Application of the first equation permitted estimation of extracted volumes and associated greenhouse gas emissions from two additional logging concessions. We discuss the application of these equations to areas that have been identified as illegal logging concessions, and propose that these may be applied to larger regions across the country. These equations offer a way to estimate volumes of timber extraction when no ground data is available, and to calculate greenhouse gas emissions associated with extracted volumes, providing a simple methodology useful across forested tropical countries. © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Tangguh Integrated Drilling Project (TIDP) is being rolled out by BP Indonesia as part of long term development plan for Tangguh project in Bintuni Bay, Papua Barat Province. The offshore drilling campaign consists of several development, exploration, and appraisal wells throughout the bay. The complex scope of work for TIDP and regulatory requirement require a systematic holistic approach to come up with appropriate drilling fluids and cuttings waste management strategy. A multidisciplinary team consists of: Wells Engineering, Operations, Health Safety and Environment, New Wells Delivery, Regulatory Compliance & Environment, Communications & External Affair, Permits, and Central fluids were established to discuss the strategy. Best Practicable Environmental Option (BPEO) tool was decided to be used. The assessment model incorporates weightings for criteria which enables more important criteria to be emphasized and also enables sensitivity checking. BPEO process flow are as follows: define objectives, decision criteria and scoring matrices, weight the decision criteria, identify all possible options, pre-screening, full assessment, review and rank options, and finally identify the BPEO. The study concludes that for cost effectiveness, practical application, efficiency, HS&E risk mitigation, and reduced (if not elimination of) long term liability, the waste processing and disposal should take place at the rig site. The study further concludes that there is no single best option for all drilling locations due to different constraints. Therefore, the recommendation is to have the combined option of Drilling Cuttings Re-Injection (DCRI) and overboard discharge that can be utilized across all locations in Tangguh. With this study, the team is not only eliminating the environmental and safety risk inherent in offshore drilling, handling and transportation of large amount of drilling cuttings and fluids waste, but it also save costs on constructing several dedicated DCRI wells and reduced 200 drilling days from the jack up rig scope. Another impact is that it reduces the carbon footprint and greenhouse gases coming from the drilling and its supporting activities such as vessel utilization. The result from this BPEO can support management, engineers, and operations team in the decision-making process to determine the most suitable option among several scenarios or any other complex project. It could also provide a sound justification to the regulators to expedite the permitting process. © 2018 Offshore Technology Conference.},

	abstract = {Swamp forests on deep tropical peatlands have undergone extensive deforestation and draining for agriculture and plantations, consequently becoming globally significant carbon (C) sources. To study the effects of land-use change on peat as a biological environment, which directly affects decomposition dynamics and greenhouse gas emissions, we sampled peat from four common land-use types representing different management intensities in Central Kalimantan, Indonesia. The near-pristine swamp forest was used to describe unmanaged conditions, and the three other sites in order of increasing management intensity were reforested; degraded; and agricultural. We examined peat substrate quality (total C & nitrogen (N), dissolved organic C (DOC) and N (DON)), organic matter quality characterized by infrared spectroscopy, and microbial biomass and extracellular enzyme activity, to describe both biotic and abiotic conditions in peat. We found that the peat at altered sites was poorer in quality, i.e. decomposability, as demonstrated by the higher intensity of aromatic and aliphatic compounds, and lower intensity of polysaccharides, and concentration of total N, DOC, and DON compared to the peat in the swamp forest. The observed differences in peat properties can be linked to changes in litter input and decomposition conditions altered after deforestation and draining, as well as increased leaching and fires. The quality of the peat substrate was directly related to its biotic properties, with altered sites generally having lower microbial biomass and enzyme activity. However, irrespective of management intensity or substrate quality, enzyme activity was limited primarily to the first 0–3 cm of the peat profile. Some differences between wet and dry seasons were observed in enzyme activity especially in swamp forest, where the most measured enzyme activities were higher in dry season. Reforestation 6 years before our measurements had not yet restored enzyme activity in the peat to the level of the swamp forest, although the topmost peat characteristics in the reforested site already resembled those in the swamp forest. This is likely contributed by the limited capacity of the young tree stand to produce litter to support peat formation and restore the quality and structure of the peat, and the chemical weed control performed at the site. Therefore, we conclude that intensive land management, including deforestation and draining, leads to the surface peat becoming poorer biological environment, and it may take long time to restore the peat properties. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to increasing global demand for palm oil, coal, and timber, Indonesia has become the largest contributor of greenhouse gases from primary forest loss in the world. Carbon market mechanisms, like Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+), are being promoted by many elements of Indonesia's government as an effective policy response. The REDD+ programme is designed to enable the provision of financial compensations to protect and restore standing forests by making them more valuable than the timber they contain. However, the logic of REDD+ constructs people living in and around project sites as environmentally destructive and therefore in need of incentivisation to do otherwise. Local people are compensated for the 'opportunity costs' of not degrading forests. Within this frame 'locals' - suffering from the malaise of dispossession - are Othered as illegal loggers, poachers, greedy miners or arsonists. In reality, REDD+ often facilitates the continuation of violence, legitimising an image of small-holders, rather than large international corporations, as the cause of forest degradation in Indonesia. Focusing on the Sungai Lamandau REDD+ project of Central Kalimantan, I discuss how, for some of Sungai Lamandau's landless farmers, REDD+ is accelerating the very violence and environmentally destructive behaviours it claims to discourage. Farmers are becoming embroiled in other ongoing processes, pushing them towards illicit livelihood strategies, sometimes with devastating outcomes. Copyright © Howson 2018.},

	abstract = {This study comprises a comprehensive assessment, integration, and synthesis of data gathered from a 3-year field experiment conducted at four sites in Southeast Asia, namely Hue, Vietnam; Jakenan, Indonesia; Prachin Buri, Thailand; and Muñoz, Philippines, to assess the site-specific feasibility of alternate wetting and drying (AWD) as a greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation option in irrigated rice fields. AWD effectively reduced water use compared to continuous flooding (CF) but did not significantly reduce rice grain yield and soil carbon content in all sites. Methane (CH4) emissions varied significantly among sites and seasons as affected by soil properties and water management. AWD reduced CH4 emissions relative to CF by 151 (25%), 166 (37%), 9 (31%), and 22 (32%) kg CH4 ha−1 season−1 in Hue, Jakenan, Prachin Buri, and Muñoz, respectively. In Prachin Buri and Muñoz, AWD reduced CH4 emissions only during the dry season. Site-specific CH4 emission factors (EFs) ranged 0.13–4.50 and 0.08–4.88 kg CH4 ha−1 d−1 under CF and AWD, respectively. The mean AWD scaling factors (SFs) was 0.69 (95% confidence interval: 0.61–0.77), which is slightly higher than the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)’ SF for multiple aeration of 0.52 (error range: 0.41–0.66). Significant reductions in the global warming potential (GWP) of CH4+nitrous oxide (N2O) by AWD were observed in Hue and Jakenan (27.8 and 36.1%, respectively), where the contributions of N2O to the total GWP were only 0.8 and 3.5%, respectively. In Muñoz, however, CH4 emission reduction through AWD was offset by the increase in N2O emissions. The results indicate that the IPCC’s SF for multiple aeration may only be applied to irrigated rice fields where surface water level is controllable for a substantial period. This study underscores the importance of practical feasibility and appropriate timing of water management in successful GHG reductions by AWD. © 2017 Japanese Society of Soil Science and Plant Nutrition.},

	abstract = {The Paris Agreement calls for maintaining a global temperature less than 2°C above the pre-industrial level and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5°C. To realize this objective and promote a low-carbon society, and because energy production and use is the largest source of global greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions, it is important to efficiently manage energy demand and supply systems. This, in turn, requires theoretical and practical research and innovation in smart energy monitoring technologies, the identification of appropriate methods for detailed time-series analysis, and the application of these technologies at urban and national scales. Further, because developing countries contribute increasing shares of domestic energy consumption, it is important to consider the application of such innovations in these areas. Motivated by the mandates set out in global agreements on climate change and low-carbon societies, this paper focuses on the development of a smart energy monitoring system (SEMS) and its deployment in households and public and commercial sectors in Bogor, Indonesia. An electricity demand prediction model is developed for each device using the Auto-Regression eXogenous model. The real-time SEMS data and time-series clustering to explore similarities in electricity consumption patterns between monitored units, such as residential, public, and commercial buildings, in Bogor is, then, used. These clusters are evaluated using peak demand and Ramadan term characteristics. The resulting energy-prediction models can be used for low-carbon planning. © 2018, Higher Education Press and Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The surface area of the roofs was determined using Polygon feature of Google Earth TM. The energy output of the system was simulated with SolarGIS pvPlanner software program. The grid-connected PV system type was chosen in the simulation. Greenhouse gas (GHG) emission reduction analysis was carried out using RETScreen program simulation. It was found that about 10,353 m2 of the rooftop of the university buildings could be used for panel installation. The total capacity of the panels is found about 2,070 kWp with total electricity production is about 3,180 MWh per year and could supply up to 80% of the campus energy demand. The system would serve as a means of reducing 3,367.6; 2,477.2, or 1,195.7 tons of CO2 to the atmosphere in comparison to the same amount of electricity produced by burning coal, oil, or natural gas respectively. The unit cost of PV electricity was found ranging from 0.10 - 0.20 USD/kWh.

The increasing number of companies in the region will result in raised levels of CO2 emissions because of their transport and logistics activity. This paper aims to develop a CO2 emissions framework by considering the actual conditions of the region, and by calculating the level of emissions with a case study of Indonesia. Several steps were involved in the design of the framework. First, research was conducted on available frameworks which estimate CO2 emissions in logistics. Second, the model for CO2 emissions calculation was built by breaking down all the factors influencing calculations. Third, the model was applied using distribution network data of companies in Indonesia. The output of the research is a framework which helps companies to calculate CO2 emissions, and which gauges the level of such emissions generated by companies operating in Indonesia. In addition, the impact of the different distribution network scenarios on the amount of CO2 emissions produced is assessed. © IJTech 2018.},

	abstract = {Global climate change has prompted the Government of the Republic of Indonesia to commit to an active role and participation in the attempt of reducing Greenhouse Gas (GRK) emission through a national action program. One of the biggest sectors contributing in the production of GRK is transportation. Meanwhile, the condition of roads also affect the speed of vehicles. This study analyzed the relationship between road condition and travel speed, and the resulting CO2 emission. This research was conducted by taking some class III roads in Brebes as samples. The stages of this study include assessing the road condition by using the PCI method, calculating the average speed of vehicle on each sample road, and from the data of travel speed, the value of CO2 emission was then calculated using IPCC method. The result of this study indicated that the road condition is the factor that affects the travel speed. Increasing the value of PCI by 10 points from the lowest value will reduce CO2 emissions by 3.36% for gasoline-fueled vehicles. This research suggests improving the road condition in Brebes district in order to support Local Action Plan for Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

	abstract = {Rice is a staple food for over half the global population and is mostly produced by smallholders. Rice cultivation at global level is responsible for over 10% of global agricultural greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and about 1.3%–1.8% of the anthropogenic GHG emissions. Taking time series data from the World Bank, Food and Agriculture Organisation, International Rice Research Institute and United States Department of Agriculture, this study aims to compare the trends and magnitudes of rice yield, per capita rice consumption and its relationships with per capita income and life expectancy, as well as CH4 and N2O emissions from rice farming among the eight different countries (China, India, Vietnam, Thailand, the Philippines, Myanmar, Bangladesh and Indonesia) which, collectively, account for about 82.05% of the global rice production and 78.23% of the global rice consumption. Moreover, agricultural practices as a whole in these eight countries is responsible for 35% of global agricultural emissions. Over the 54 year period of study from 1961 to 2014, rice yield increased significantly in all countries; however, the current pace is not sufficient to meet the increasing demands. Similarly, results suggest that the generalisation of rice consumption behaviour—as normal or inferior goods—is misleading and is largely influenced by the culture, norms, values and beliefs of a given country. Although the absolute amounts of GHG emissions from rice cultivation has increased in all countries during the study period, the corresponding emission intensities have declined sharply, mainly due to the rapid increase in yield. Among the eight countries, China and Vietnam's performance was better in terms of their increased yield, decreasing rates of emissions intensity and a lower water footprint whilst Thailand's performance was poorest. The differences between the different countries and practices which enable more rice to be produced with less water, energy and land are also discussed. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd},

A possible solution is the green concrete made from fly ash based-geopolymer paste. The natural differences of Indonesian coal ash lead to various chemical contents of fly ash. The chemical composition of alkali activated paste is also varied causing differences in the strength of the paste. Silica to alumina ratio is indicated as the greatest influencing factor to geopolymer strength. The bond among silica-alumina preserves a compact microstructure resulting in the strength. This paper proposes a Si-Al ratio between 1.5 and 2.0 by adding a synthetic aluminium substance from some sources. Using a natural aluminium substance from other fly ashes which contain excessive amounts of Al2O3 was one of that efforts. The result indicated that the addition of a small amount of aluminium powder showed insignificant differences in geopolymer strength. The powder addition of up to 4% of fly ash decreased the strength by up to 60% of the original one. The methods of mixing are indicated as the trigger of lower strength because. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences, 2018.},

	abstract = {Road infrastructure in Indonesia is mainly dominated by flexible pavement type. Its construction process, however, has raised concerns in terms of its environment impacts. This study aims to track and measure the carbon footprint of flexible pavement. The objectives are to map the construction process in relation to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, to quantify them in terms of carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) as generated by the process of production and transportation of raw materials, and the operation of plant off-site and on-site project. Data collection was done by having site observations and interviews with project stakeholders. The results show a total emissions of 70.888 tonnes CO2e, consisting of 34.248 tonnes CO2e (48.31%) off-site activities and 36.640 tonnes CO2e (51.687%) on-site activities. The two highest CO2e emissions were generated by the use of plant for asphalt concrete laying activities accounted 34.827 tonnes CO2e (49.130%), and material transportation accounted 24.921 (35.155%). These findings provide a new perspective of the carbon footprint in flexible pavement and suggest the urgent need for the use of more efficient and environmentally friendly plant in construction process as it shows the most significant contribution on the CO2e. This study provides valuable understanding on the environmental impact of typical flexible pavement projects in Indonesia, and further can be used for developing green road framework. © 2018 The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.},

	abstract = {Indonesia is now the country with the highest deforestation rate in the world, and due to the high rate of associated land use change, Indonesia has also become one of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters in the world. It is commonly thought that the cause of this is Indonesia's high dependence on the forest-related sector. To investigate the role of forest-related sectors to the Indonesian economy, this study tried to analyze the Social Accounting Matrix (SAM) multiplier from 1985-2008. It was found that there is a tendency for the forest-related sector to contribute a higher multiplier effect to the economy, meaning that Indonesia's economy is very dependent on the forest-related sector. However, the contribution to the economy is paid for by a high rate of deforestation. Our analysis predicts that the high deforestation rate is mainly due to the establishment of new commercial plantation areas, especially palm oil, and the high rate of illegal logging. © 2018 Marissa Malahayati, published by De Gruyter.},

	abstract = {Deforestation and forest degradation, after burning of fossil fuels, is considered as the second leading cause of anthropogenic greenhouse emissions (accounting for over 17% of global carbon dioxide emissions) and has become an important issue concerning climate change mitigation. The provision of wood energy is generally thought to be a major contributor to forest loss. In Indonesia, more than half of the rainforest there, the third-largest swath in the world, has been felled in just a few years. Furthermore, permission has been granted to convert the majority of what remains into palm or acacia plantations. The logging and burning of forests to clear land for cultivation has made Indonesia one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases. Therefore, the objective of this study was to assess the current level and influencing factors of the use of fuelwood among the rural population as well as the consequent environmental impacts in the target area in North Sumatra. The questionnaire survey using randomly selected households (n = 196) was administered in Tapanuli Utara regency from July to August 2014; followed by several field visits from August to September 2016. Obtained data were analysed with descriptive statistics and cross tabulation. The results indicate that fuelwood is a significant source of energy in the target area. For 31% of respondents it is the major energy source and for 64% it is a supplementary source. The high rate of use of wood as fuel corresponds to the poor financial situation of respondents and the easy accessibility of wood, but only from the surrounding area (own garden or adjacent land). Wood resources are often very distant (on average over 1,000 metres) as a consequence of high deforestation. This study reveals that there is a non-sustainable trend of forest conversion resulting in high land degradation in Tapanuli Utara regency. © 2018, Eesti Pollumajandusulikool. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Climate change, pollution, and energy insecurity are currently critical worldwide problems. To improve worldwide energy security and supply, new policies regarding renewable energy and new infrastructure should be developed. Since 2006, Indonesia's dependency on oil imports has been increasing significantly. Recent policies on renewable energy have been issued to cope with the issue. This study focuses on describing the feasibility of using biogas for energy production in Indonesia. Biogas contains 50–70% methane and 30–50% carbon dioxide and has a calorific value of 21–24 MJ/Nm3. Therefore, it can be potentially altered to contain 97% methane prior to injecting into natural gas networks. The prospective derivation of biogas from cattle, pig, and chicken waste in Indonesia could reach approximately 79 Trillion Watt-hours (TWh). In order to use biogas for power generation, two scenarios were created. The electricity demand, the environmental impact and the reduction of GHG emissions were considered over the next 20 years. The first scenario depended on current energy policy and the second scenario depended on biogas as a substitute for the fossil fuel that is still used for generating power. The carbon dioxide (CO2), carbon monoxide (CO), sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), particulate matter (PM), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were estimated for each scenario. A resource analysis of the biogas derived from animal wastes was estimated and the economics of biogas production were described. Finally, the most recent renewable energy policies were described to promote the development of this sector. © 2017},

	abstract = {The study was conducted in three land cover conditions (secondary peat forest, shrub land, and palm plantation) that were burned in the Siak District, Riau Province, Indonesia year 2015. Measurement and calculation carbon emission from soil and vegetation of peatland should be done accurately to be implemented on climate change mitigation or greenhouse gases mitigation. The objective of the study was to estimate the carbon emission caused peatland fires in the Siak District, Riau Province, Indonesia year 2015. Estimated carbon emissions were performed using visual method and digital method. The visual method was a method that uses on-screen digitization assisted by hotspot data, the presence of smoke, and fire suppression data. The digital method was a method that uses the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) index. The estimated carbon emissions were calculated using the equation that was developed from IPCC 2006 in Verified Carbon Standard 2015. The results showed that the estimation of carbon emissions from fires from above the peat soil surface were higher than the carbon emissions from the peat soil. Carbon emissions above the peat soil surface of 1376.51 ton C/ha were obtained by visual method while 3984.33 ton C/ha were obtained by digital method. Peatland carbon emissions of 6.6 x 10-4 ton C/ha were obtained by visual method, whereas 2.84 x 10-3 ton C/ha was obtained by digital method. Visual method and digital method using remote sensing must be combined and developed in order to carbon emission values will be more accurate. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Economically, peatland plays an important role since they can be reclaimed for agriculture. Shallow peat (<100 cm) can be used to grow food crops including vegetables. Peatland has also become attractive for development of large-scale oil palm and rubber plantations. However, peatland has a number of constraints in terms of greenhouse gas (GHG) emission, especially CO2 emissions in the degraded peatland. These arise from decomposition of peat. Common sense suggests three alternatives to manage GHG emissions from degraded peatland: conservation and restoration, natural recovery, and agricultural use. In this context, the challenge is to utilize degraded tropical peatland for agriculture while avoiding the negative impacts, and ensuring its environmental sustainability. This research attempts to contribute toward developing better management plans. Results of this study show that rice farming has highest sustainable score in degraded peatland. Rice farming secured a 52.14% sustainability score, while oil palm and rubber farming exhibited 47.55 and 47.67% sustainable scores, respectively. Therefore, rice farming can be considered as the first alternative for development of degraded peatland. Improved oil palm and rubber farming systems may also be subsequently considered if their sustainability can be improved. © 2017 The Author(s).

The statistics show that average rural poverty tends to be lower and Gross Regional Product tends to be higher in provinces which have greater levels of oil palm cultivation. Indonesian oil palm will grow from 10.6 in 2013 to 13.7 million ha by 2020. This will release 135.59 million tons of CO2 if nothing is done to mitigate BAU emissions. Unless there are sustained efforts to redirect development and expansion of oil palm, plantation growth will continue to encroach on intact forest and peat land.. In fact Indonesia has large areas of degraded land, an estimated total 19,144,000 ha is available for planting oil palm and other crops. A large-scale expansion program driven by estate companies needs to be accompanied by effective smallholder development program in order to achieve the best outcome for local farmers and avoid the conflicts. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Indonesian peatland forest is considered a huge sink of tropical carbon and thereby make significant contribution to global terrestrial carbon storage. However, landcover and landuse changes in this ecosystem have incurred a synergistic exposure to drought and wildfires. Deforestation and forest degradation through combustion and decomposition of forest biomass and soil carbon have become global issues because of their greenhouse gas contribution to global climate change. Thus fire-driven carbon losses in these peatlands have increased the need to evaluate the impacts of fire at a landscape scale. In 6–10 week dry periods from January to April 2014 and in January 2015, wildfires burnt peatland forest in Kubu Raya, West Kalimantan province (Indonesian Borneo). An assessment was conducted to provide more reliable estimates of the effects of fire on aboveground and soil carbon losses and their dynamics in the coastal peatlands of the province. Carbon loss from combustion of both aboveground biomass and peat soil was substantial. Moreover, CO2 emission from soil respiration at the burnt peat surface increased 46% over the first 9 months after the fire. This study clearly showed the magnitude of fire-driven carbon loss and the scale of CO2 emission to the atmosphere arising from fire in tropical peatland forest. © Forest Research Institute Malaysia},

	abstract = {Due to an increasing global demand in cheap oils and biofuels, forest conversion to oil palm plantations is rapidly increasing in Indonesia. Oil palm canopy soil, or the soil lodged between the stems and leaf axils of oil palms, is one ecosystem compartment that has yet to be investigated as to its importance on the soil greenhouse gas budget. Our objectives were 1) to quantify nitrous oxide (N2O) and methane (CH4) fluxes from oil palm canopy soil, and 2) to determine the factors controlling these fluxes. Our study was conducted in Jambi Province, Indonesia, an area of rapid oil palm expansion. Trace gas fluxes were measured in eight smallholder oil palm plantations (9–16 years old). In each plantation, oil palms were delineated into three 1-m height sections (low, middle, and top) to represent possible gradients of canopy soil conditions that influence N2O and CH4 fluxes. Trace gas fluxes were measured by collecting canopy soil from each stem section and immediately incubating in the field in an air-tight glass jar. Canopy soils from all oil palm stem sections emitted N2O and CH4. The top stem section had higher N2O and CH4 emissions than the lower sections, and this pattern was paralleled by nitrogen availability and water content, which strongly influenced these fluxes. Greenhouse gas emissions per unit dry mass of canopy soil were considerable, but on a hectare basis these emissions were small due to the low amount of canopy soil per hectare (170 kg ha−1). Annual canopy soil N2O and CH4 emissions were 10.7 ± 3.3 g N2O-N ha−1 yr−1 and 1.9 ± 0.5 g CH4-C ha−1 yr−1, respectively, which contributed only 1% of the total soil (canopy soil + ground soil) N2O fluxes and 0.2% of the ground soil net CH4 consumption. Our estimate of oil palm canopy soil emissions in Jambi Province were 7.7 Mg N2O-N yr−1 and 1.3 Mg CH4-C yr−1. Considering the increasing areal coverage of oil palm plantations in Southeast Asia, these fluxes may substantially contribute to soil greenhouse gas budgets. © 2018},

	abstract = {The forests of Kalimantan are under severe pressure from extensive land use activities dominated by logging, palm oil plantations, and peatland fires. To implement the forest moratorium for mitigating greenhouse gas emissions, Indonesia's government requires information on the carbon stored in forests, including intact, degraded, secondary, and peat swamp forests. We developed a hybrid approach of producing a wall-to-wall map of the aboveground biomass (AGB) of intact and degraded forests of Kalimantan at 1 ha grid cells by combining field inventory plots, airborne lidar samples, and satellite radar and optical imagery. More than 110 000 ha of lidar data were acquired to systematically capture variations of forest structure and more than 104 field plots to develop lidar-biomass models. The lidar measurements were converted into biomass using models developed for 66 439 ha of drylands and 44 250 ha of wetland forests. By combining the AGB map with the national land cover map, we found that 22.3 Mha (106 ha) of forest remain on drylands ranging in biomass from 357.2 ±12.3 Mgha-1 in relatively intact forests to 134.2 ±6.1 Mgha-1 in severely degraded forests. The remaining peat swamp forests are heterogeneous in coverage and degradation level, extending over 3.62 Mha and having an average AGB of 211.8 ±12.7 Mgha-1. Emission factors calculated from aboveground biomass only suggest that the carbon storage potential of more than 15 Mha of degraded and secondary dryland forests will be about 1.1 PgC. © 2018 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Two different fruit and vegetable waste (FVW) collection and treatment systems have been evaluated and compared with the existing system in the largest traditional market located in Bandung city, Indonesia. In this study, greenhouse gas quantification was performed to compare the environmental impact of current landfill practices against two different options: (i) on-site composting, and (ii) on-site anaerobic digestion. In addition to this, the economic performance was also evaluated by estimating the cost-output ratio from cost-effectiveness analysis and the payback period. The evaluation results were then presented in the matrix of strength, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats (SWOT) to provide an insight for the decision maker in determining the most appropriate solution for fruit and vegetable waste treatment system in the traditional markets. The results indicated that the alteration of FVWmanagement system from the landfill to an on-site composting would decrease the cost-output ratio by 20%. Meanwhile, the implementation of an on-site anaerobic digestion showed a negative value of cost-output ratio indicating a profitable system. Furthermore, the estimation on net energy balance revealed that one ton of waste treated in a landfill, composting and anaerobic digestion would result in 3.52, 0.01 and -0.12 ton CO2-eq, with the negative sign indicating the energy production. In addition, the payback period for anaerobic digestion and composting are remarkably short; around 8 and 13 months, respectively. These two alternatives, however, would be less advantageous if the government cannot ensure the availability of target sectors that may benefit from the utilization of compost and digestate. © 2018, Int.

The purpose of this research is to determine the effects of land use change on water pollution and climate parameters at Code river. The results showed that Code River is experiencing land use conversion. Rice field was the most extensively reduced land use, by 467.496 ha. Meanwhile, the other land uses, namely plantation, grass, and forest, were reduced by 111.475 ha, 31.218 ha, and 1.307 ha, respectively. The least converted land use was bushed, whose decreased 0.403 ha. The land use conversion in the study area deteriorated the water quality of river, as proven by the increasing trend of COD and BOD from 2012 to 2016.

	abstract = {This paper examines the impact of promoting clean (renewable) energy production through feed-in tariff (FIT) schemes on Indonesia’s economy and on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. For numerical analysis, we designed a hybrid computable general equilibrium (CGE) model that explicitly incorporates electricity generation technologies. The Indonesian FITs have been stipulated in Government Regulation No. 79/2014 on National Energy Policy. We assume that the government sets a 15% subsidy rate for renewable generation technologies. Two possible financing schemes are implemented: (i) the FIT is paid by electricity consumers through the endogenous electricity tax rate; and (ii) the FIT is financed by a carbon tax adjustment. The results show that the effects of both FIT scenarios on macroeconomic and CO2 emission accounts are negligible. These negligible effects are due to the low shares of renewables (geothermal and hydro) generation load in total electricity mix. Therefore, we argue that Indonesia’s current FIT regulation is insufficient to boost the national clean energy production and therefore is ineffective to reduce the national emissions. © 2018, © 2018 ANU Indonesia Project.},

	abstract = {The oil and gas industry has often been blamed for its major contribution to greenhouse gas releases and designated as a target to knock down by media, activists, and environmentalists. It is true to say that without Oil and Gas Industry, anthropogenic emissions of CO2 and CH4 would be much lower. Similarly, it is also true to state that without this industry and petroleum products, our life standards would be much different than the current standards. One should not confuse an activity which generates greenhouse gases, and the effect of product consumption. Evaluating the real routine emissions of the oil and gas industry on the same mode than every other industry is possible and constitutes the objective of this work. As a preliminary result, however, data coming from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) clearly highlight that oil and gas production accounts for at least less than 10% of the greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector in the United States. To more precisely evaluate these emissions, this study relied on environmental impact reports in terms of greenhouse gas emissions, which are available for every production site in the U.S, as well as the oil and gas consumption in the US over the year 2015. Emissions happen during three different stages of the hydrocarbon production; extraction, flaring and venting, and fugitive emissions. The importance of each stage in terms of emissions is extremely variable, depending on the quality of the oil, the field location, and the existence of an outlet for the produced gas. The greenhouse gas emissions contribution from the Oil and Gas industry is 3% for extraction, and about 0% for flaring and venting, and 0% of fugitive emissions in the US. The remaining U.S greenhouse gas emissions while processing petroleum products are due to refining at 88%, and transportation at 9%. However, these results are extremely different for Canadian oil sands, Venezuela heavy oil, Arabian light oil, or Indonesian gas condensate. Worldwide, greenhouse emission source for petroleum industry are 10% for extraction, 19% for flaring and venting, 6% of fugitive emissions, 4% of transport, and 61% of the refinery. As a result, 3.5% of greenhouse gases emitted while processing petroleum products are due to Oil and Gas industry. Based on these results, an extrapolation to the worldwide Oil and Gas production enable to assess the participation of this industry to total emissions. Results show that less than 3 % of worldwide greenhouse emissions comes actually from Oil and Gas industry. © Copyright 2018, Society of Petroleum Engineers.},

	abstract = {The increase of greenhouse gasses effect is one of the causes of climate change. The use of vehicles with fossil fuels is one of the contributors to pollution and global warming. Another reason why dependence on it should be reduced is the lack of Indonesia's petroleum reserves compared to other OPEC countries. Researchers are trying to anticipate this by developing electric vehicles capable of operating without pollution. Implementation of electric vehicles has begun with the electric train, tram, electric bus, and others. Vehicles with rails get electricity supplies from the grid along the tracks, but the type of freely moving vehicle without a rail requires another way to get electricity supplies. Electric vehicles with power storage (battery) have an advantage in the roaming area if supported by proper recharging techniques. In electric vehicles, the battery is recharged by the direct charging process or swapped with other one (swapping). If the vehicle has high mobility, such as public transport (bus) then the shortest charging time may be very important. © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Understanding the dynamics of carbon mineralization of peats in the tropical areas is of essential significance in controlling carbon dioxide (CO2) gas emission rates. An incubation study of tropical peats sampled from 3 different sites of the Barito Basin on the Borneo Island, Indonesia (uncultivated, used for paddy cultivation for ≤ 5 years and 5-10 years) was carried out to investigate a relationship between CO2 production and peat characteristics. Results of study revealed that land use change from uncultivated peats to paddy fields resulted in significant changes in the chemical structure of peat organic carbon. Carbohydrate contents of the peat decreased significantly as a consequence of the conversion of natural peats to paddy fields. However, the paddy peats contained higher lignin than uncultivated peats. Changes in the chemical structure of the tropical peats resulted in changes in carbon mineralization. Carbon mineralization of uncultivated peats ranged from 2925–5310 mg CO2-C kg-1 peat, while carbon mineralization of 1065–2678 mg CO2-C kg-1 C peat was observed for paddy peats. Moreover, carbon mineralization data obtained from the experiment fitted properly to a two-pool C mineralization model. The developed carbon mineralization model showed that slowly and rapidly decomposable pools have a close relation with rubbed fiber and carbohydrate content data. Thus, results of this study suggested that carbon mineralization of peats could be estimated appropriately using rubbed fiber and carbohydrate content data. © 2018, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.
