	abstract = {Global warming is adversely affecting the earth's climate system due to rapid emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Consequently, the world's coastal ecosystems are rapidly approaching a dangerous situation. In this study, we formulate a mathematical model to assess the impact of rapid emissions of GHGs on climate change and coastal ecosystems. Furthermore, we develop a mitigation method involving two control strategies: coastal greenbelt and desulfurization. Here, greenbelt is considered in coastal areas to reduce the concentrations of GHGs by absorbing the environmental carbon dioxide (CO2), whereas desulfurization is considered in factories and industries to reduce GHG emissions by controlling the release of harmful sulfur compounds. The model and how it can control the situation are analytically veriﬁed. Numerical results of this study are conﬁrmed by comparison with other studies that examine different scenarios. Results show that both control strategies can mitigate GHG concentrations, curtail global warming and to some extent manage climate change. The results further reveal that both control strategies are more effective than one control method. Overall, the results suggest that the concentrations of GHGs and the effects of climate change can be controlled by adopting sufﬁcient coastal greenbelt and desulfurization techniques in various industries.},

We use qualitative sequential methodology, involving empiric analysis that provides coherence and viability for our study, but also quantitative methods, including Dynamic Ordinary Least Squares (DOLS), unit root tests and cointegration techniques. The results suggest the existence of a long run cointegrating relationship between growth and CO2 emissions in EU countries and the DOLS method indicates a statistically signiﬁcant effect of economic growth on CO2 emissions for both versions of estimators, revealing that on average, a 1\% change in GDP leads to 0.072 change in CO2 emissions. The study also exhibits that higher income levels lead to increased demand for environmental protection and underline the need for designing environmental policies, capable to reduce emissions during periods of economic growth. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the status of economic growth does not automatically diminish climate vulnerability in EU countries, only the correct type of growth does, thus being necessary that EU policymakers be aware of the energy cost pressure and to achieve economic growth in relationship with appropriate tools in terms of climate risk management.},

The nonlinear (asymmetric) relationship is investigated between ­CO2 emission and COVID-19 with its specific determinants. The positive and negative asymmetries of COVID-19 determinants are also captured by using econometric techniques. The daily data series of ­CO2 emission, new confirmed cases, confirmed deaths, and lockdown as dummy variables from January 30, 2020, to December 1, 2020, for India is analyzed by employing the nonlinear autoregressive distributed lag model. This research revealed a significant nonlinear relationship between C­ O2 emission and COVID-19. The bound test and asymmetric coefficients are confirmed by the variables’ long- and short-run relationships. The dynamic multiplier graphs present that India’s strict lockdown due to the rapid increase in COVID-19 patients significantly reduces toxic gas emissions, especially ­CO2 emissions. This asymmetric relationship has been proficiently declared that unhealthy public routine, extra traffic, and unhygienic gases released in the air become the reason for environmental destruction. The lockdown is practically imposed for specific periods and reasons, contributing to reducing toxic emissions, but it is not a permanent solution for environmental sustainability. The government of India, policymakers, and environmentalists should make people aware of unhealthy and environmentally envying activities and policies and long-term applicable strategies should be designed to upgrade the environment’s quality.},

For this reason, Hutama Karya is trying to develop core technology in the development of renewable energy in Indonesia. The core technology in question is the High RPM Small Dimension Permanent Magnet Generator. This PMSG has unique operating characteristics in the form of high RPM but low torque, making it suitable for application to renewable energy generation. The biggest challenge today is to ensure that the existing manufacturing technology in Indonesia is sufficient to produce the PMSG. Our findings indicate that manufacturing technology in Indonesia is sufficient to produce PMSG with 100 kW power capacity. It is indicated by the result of early testing that the generator can produce Electrical Coefficient (EC) value of 0.15.},

As we all know, climate change is a big challenge for Indonesia and the world. Starting from changes in temperature, changes in rainfall patterns, drought and lack of clean water, extreme weather changes, to rising sea levels, climate change occurs due to increasing concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrogen oxides (N2O). To complete the data, this research will be enriched with primary data in the form of interviews and field observations at one of the Starbuck outlets and use library research data collection techniques by utilizing secondary data collected from libraries, books, journals, articles, print media, electronic media and websites. The descriptiveanalytical approach was used to collect and analyze the data. The analysis of this research uses green theory and green marketing to find out why and to what extent Starbucks Indonesia's contribution contributes to environmentally friendly issues. Environmental issues are issues all over the world that often arise. Governments, organizations and some groups have been actively holding business companies to account regarding environmental damage such as unusual climate change, global warming, natural resource degradation, and population. In this case, the aim is for consumers to have significant environmental awareness and become more concerned with green products and contribute to a green environment.},

Furthermore, a multi-objective optimization is performed in terms of minimizing CO2 emissions and total annual cost using epsilon-constraint method. The optimal energy system due to the minimum-cost solution includes a 1065 m2 solar collector and a 1265 kW boiler in combination with 967 kWh and 25 MWh short-term and long-term heat storages, respectively. The 30 \% carbon reduction policy results in a 70.5 \% increase in solar collector area. The selected optimal solution of the Pareto front, which is the closest solution to the ideal point, has 35.3 \% more annual cost and 89.5 \% less CO2 emissions compared to the minimum-cost solution.},

            Water distribution networks are crucial for supplying consumers with quality and adequate water. A water distribution system comprises connected hydraulic components which ensure water supply and distribution to meet demand. Optimization of water distribution networks is carried out to minimize resource utilization and expenditure or maximize the system’s efficiency and higher benefits. Genetic algorithms signify an effective search technique for non-linear optimization problems and have gained acceptance among water resources planners and managers. This paper reviews various developments in the optimization of water distribution systems using the technique of genetic algorithms. These developments are pertinent to creating novel systems for distributing water and the expansion, reinforcement, and rehabilitation process for prevailing water supply mechanisms.

In order to find the optimal path for AUV to reach the specified destination in complex undersea environment, an improved ant colony optimization (ACO) algorithm based on particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed. Due to the various constraints, such as the limited energy and limited visual distance, the improved ACO algorithm uses improved pheromone update rule and heuristic function based on PSO algorithm to make AUV find the optimal path by connecting the chosen nodes of the undersea environment while avoiding the collision with the complex undersea terrain (static obstacles). The improved ACO algorithm based on PSO algorithm can overcome disadvantages of the traditional ACO algorithm, such as falling into local extremum, poor quality, and low accuracy. Experiment results demonstrate that improved ACO algorithm is more effective and feasible in path planning for autonomous underwater vehicle than the traditional ant colony algorithm.},

	abstract = {Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) has been frequently employed to solve diversiﬁed optimization problems. Choosing initial placement for population plays an important role in meta-heuristic methods since they can signiﬁcantly converge. In this study, probability distribution has been introduced to enhance the diversity of swarm and convergence speed. Population initialization method based on uniform distribution is normally used when there is no preceding knowledge available regarding the candidate solution. In this paper, a new approach to initialize population is proposed using probability sequence Weibull marked as (WI-PSO) that applies the probability distribution to generate numbers at random locations for swarm initialization. The proposed method (WI-PSO) is tested on sixteen well-known unimodal and multi-modal benchmark test functions broadly adopted by the research community and its encouraging performance is investigated and compared with the Exponential distribution based PSO (EPSO), Beta distribution based PSO (BT-PSO), Gamma distribution based PSO (GA-PSO) and Log-normal distribution based PSO (LN-PSO). Artiﬁcial Neural Networks (ANNs) have become the most powerful tool for classiﬁcation of complex benchmark problems. We have experimented the proposed method (WIPSO) for weight optimization of a feed-forward neural network to ensure its purity and have compared with conventional back-propagation algorithm (BPA), E-PSO, BT-PSO, GA-PSO and LN-PSO. Due to ﬂexible behaviour in the degree of freedom, the experimental results infer the perfection and dominance of the Weibull based population initialization. The result exhibits the anticipation of inﬂuence exerted by the proposed technique on all sixteen objective functions and eight real-world benchmark data sets.},

	abstract = {The current use of fossil fuels has a significant impact on increasing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Subsequently, renewable energy is significantly needed to reduce GHG, thereby limiting the impact of extreme weather and climate while ensuring reliable, timely, and cost‐effective supply. As a big country with a huge amount natural resource, the demand for renewable energy in Indonesia has increased along with the rise in consumption. Following this, energy consumption increased by 0.99\%, which was approximately 939.100 million BOE in 2021 for biogas, oil, electricity, natural gas, coal, LPG, biodiesel, and biomass. Energy consumption in several sectors including transportation has the largest energy consumption with approximately 45.76\% of oil. In industries and households sector, the consumption rates are 31.11\% for boiler steam generation purposes and 16.89\% for electricity as well as LPG. Furthermore, the commercial sector consumes 4.97\% of energy for lighting and air conditioning, while the remaining 1.27\% is used for other sectors. Meanwhile, Indonesia has high potential for renewable energy at 419 GW including 75 GW of hydro energy, 23.7 GW of geothermal, 32.6 GW of bioenergy, 207.8 GW of solar, 60.6 GW of wind, and 19.3 GW of micro‐hydro. Therefore, the main focus of this paper is to provide a detailed analysis of the current status, prospects, and information on Indonesia’s renewable and sustainable energy sources. Furthermore, the novelty of this research entails updating the latest data related to renewable energy and its availability in Indonesia. The essence is to portray a picture of its potential development in the future.},

	abstract = {After the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world agreed to prevent the process of increasing global warming by not burning fossil reserves. The world energy development trend driven by the issue of climate change to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) points to the world's imperative to reduce the use of fossil fuels, and on the other hand increase the use of new and renewable energy. The Sustainable Development Goal (SDGs) 7 gives credence to ensuring the accessibility of clean, affordable, reliable modern energy. As a country that has ratified the Paris Agreement, Indonesia is committed to reducing Greenhouse Gas emissions (GHG) in order to mitigate climate change through energy sector. In Indonesia, energy-based policies have their own challenges ranging from regulation to communications. There is also limited research on the role of communication in driving the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions to tackle climate change and sustainable development goals. This study aims to identify energy sectors related to climate change mitigation, and to explore relationship between stakeholders in communicating energy policies for climate change mitigation actions in Indonesia. Through in-depth interviews with government officials, participant-observation, literature study, and government documents review, this study concludes that there has been no strategic government communication to glue scientific messages for climate change mitigation action and SDGs goals in energy sector. The highest leadership commitment is needed to communicate the urgency of climate change related to energy sector and to build a sustainable messaging development for reducing GHG emissions and tackling climate change.},

The research results show that all variables affect the escalation of greenhouse gas emissions in Indonesia. Furthermore, there is a bidirectional causality relationship between emissions with economic growth, emissions with agricultural sector, emissions with manufacturing sector, economic growth with agricultural sector, and economic growth with manufacturing. The unidirectional causality is found in emissions by urbanization and economic growth by urbanization. To reduce the impact of environmental damage caused by the activities of agriculture, manufacturing, and urbanization sectors, it is recommended that the government conduct water-efficient rice cultivation and increase the use of renewable energy.},

The results show that the effect of transportation restructuring on greenhouse gas emissions is manifested differently in different time periods. After 2008, transportation restructuring had a signiﬁcant effect on reducing the intensity of greenhouse gas emissions in all sectors. However, the impact of transportation restructuring on the intensity of non-CO2 greenhouse gas emissions is limited. It is also found that the railway transport sector has been a low-impact transport sector in terms of greenhouse gas emissions since 2004, which provides insights for the optimization of China’s transportation structure.},

To overcome the problems of local optima and the small search scope, an update strategy that uses particle swarm optimization and the tabu list method from the tabu search algorithm are utilized to enhance the optimization performance. Meanwhile, different feature patterns were employed as the input of the optimization model. These simulation results show that the proposed SO method exhibits dominant optimization performance for SO in optical lithography.},

Therefore, either in the sustainability reporting or in the corporate social and environmental reporting section, as stated in the annual report, the company usually discloses its activities related to carbon emission handling for sustainable business. In Indonesia, however, the extent of carbon emission disclosures is voluntary. The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of audit committee characteristics, financial performance, and listing age on carbon emissions reporting of highly emitted companies in Indonesia. Audit committee characteristics were measured by the number of audit committee members and the number of audit committee meetings, while Altman financial distress model measured financial performance. A checklist based on the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP) evaluated the greenhouse gas emissions disclosures. This study uses 99 companies of highly emitted industry listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. Results of multiple regression analysis indicate that the number of audit committee meetings positively affects the greenhouse gas emissions report. The result suggests that the more active the audit committee in the company in conducting meetings, the higher the company's incentives to disclose carbon emission in the company's annual report or the sustainability reporting. The study provides insight into the regulation released by the capital market authority agency regarding strengthening factors that may influence listed companies to report their carbon emission.},

In this study, to provide guidelines for developing a suitable waste management strategy for Depok, Indonesia, emissions from four waste management scenarios for the city are calculated. These scenarios involve treatments such as the application of Waste Treatment Unit (WTU), incinerator, anaerobic digester, composting, and landﬁll. The best scenario affords the treatment of 150 tons/day of municipal solid waste (MSW) via composting, 80 tons via WTU, and 500 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 390 tons/day, which are sent to a controlled landﬁll in Depok. This best scenario generates net GHG emissions of 202,800 kg CO2-eq/day, accounting for 1900 kg CO2-eq/day from transportation; 4 kg CO2eq/day from WTU; 25,700 kg CO2-eq/day from composting; 46,200 kg CO2-eq/day from anaerobic digestion; and 129,000 kg CO2-eq/day from a controlled landﬁll. By contrast, the worst scenario corresponds to the city's current waste management approach, producing net GHG emissions of 299,602.6 kg CO2-eq/day from the treatment of 600 tons/day of MSW via landﬁll, 70 tons/day via open burning, 60 tons/day via MRF, 340 tons/day via anaerobic digestion, and 40 tons/day via composting.},

	abstract = {The recent advancements in science, engineering, and technology have facilitated huge generation of datasets. These huge datasets contain noisy, redundant, and irrelevant features which negatively affects the performance of classification techniques in machine learning and data mining process. Feature selection is a pre-processing stage for reducing the dimensionality of datasets by selecting the most important attributes while increasing the accuracy of classification at the same time. In this paper, we present a novel hybrid binary version of enhanced chaotic crow search and particle swarm optimization algorithm (ECCSPSOA) to solve feature selection problems. In the proposed ECCSPSOA, in order to navigate the feature space, we hybridized the enhanced version of the CSA algorithm which has a better search strategy and particle swarm optimization (PSO) which is capable of converging into the best global solution in the search field. We further embed opposition-based learning technique in the local search of the hybrid algorithm. The ECCSPSOA was compared using 15 datasets from the UCI repository with four well-known optimization algorithms, such as particle swarm optimization (PSO), binary particle swarm optimization (BPSO), crow search algorithm (CSA), and chaotic crow search algorithm (CCSA). In the experiments with k-Nearest Neighbour (KNN) as a classifier, six different performance metrics were used. To tackle the over-fitting problem, each dataset is divided into training and testing data using K-fold cross-validation. The computational findings demonstrate that the proposed algorithm obtains an average accuracy rate of 89.67 \% over 15 datasets, indicating that our technique exceeds state-of-the-art findings in 12 of the 15 datasets studied. Furthermore, the suggested approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of fitness value and standard deviation, obtaining the lowest value in 13 and 8 of the datasets studied respectively.},

	abstract = {Developing countries in Asia are investing in rapid transit systems as a response to the problems of urban traffic congestion and satisfying rapidly expanding transport demand, particularly in metro. Metros are completely segregated from other routes and are usually elevated or underground. It is the segregation that is necessary for delivering a quick service, as well as the technology that enables for a large number of passengers to be transported. Dhaka, the capital of Bangladesh having 8.9 million of people, is facing poor status in public transportation system. Motorcycles, rickshaws, public buses, human hauler, private cars, CNG, minibuses, and taxis are the most common and heterogenous modes of transportation in Dhaka City. From an environmental standpoint, Dhaka's current transportation situation is extremely precarious. In order to solve the problem, promotion of Electric/Hybrid vehicles have been started. For the purpose of withstanding the increasing passengers demand, the government of People’s Republic of Bangladesh commissioned a comprehensive transport plan known as the Strategic Transport Plan (STP) for Greater Dhaka City and its surrounding districts in 2008. As a part of this, Bangladesh's government has set a schedule for constructing a road network of that includes six updated metro rail lines of 128.741km under the Dhaka Mass Transit Company Limited (DMTCL) which is expected to cost Tk 21,985.07 crore. The prime focus of this paper is to represent the curtailment of GHG emission due to implementation of mass transit railway systems where vehicles miles travelled data and emission factor of different vehicles have been used to calculated the GHG emission from currently available modes and the data of CO2 emission due to electricity generation has been used in case of metro rail. The method followed are selection of study area, collection of data from primary and secondary sources and analysis. The equation used for the calculation of GHG emission from transportation facilities as well as metro rail system of Bangladesh is represented with the help of literature. Primary data are collected from site visit, field survey and questionnaire survey whereas Secondary data are collected from electronic assessment of the literature which included journals, books, reports from an international organization, and articles. It has been found that currently available modes of transport emits 71,330 tons/year of GHG for passing the passengers from Uttara to Motijheel. But when MRT Line-6 of mass transit railway system will be implemented then only 18,688 tons/year of GHG will be emitted due to electricity generation which will result into a curtailment of 52,642 tons of GHG emission yearly. So, it will result into the improvement of the air quality of Dhaka city which is surely positive contribution to cut global GHG emission.},

Although, it has shown good performance in finding the optimal solution to many electromagnetic problems. However, sometimes it falls to local optima when dealing with hard optimization problems. Thus, to preserve a good balance between local and global searches to avoid premature convergence in quantum particle swarm optimization, this paper proposed three enhancements to the original QPSO method, the proposed method is called modified quantum particle swarm optimization (MQPSO) algorithm. Firstly, a novel selection technique is introduced that will choose the best particle among the population within the search domain to achieve a high-performance exploration. Secondly, a new mutation method is used to preserve the easiness of available QPSOs. Also, a dynamic parameter strategy is proposed for further facilitating the algorithm and tradeoff between exploration and exploitation searches. The experimental results obtained by solving standard benchmark functions and an electromagnetic design problem which is the superconducting magnetic energy storage (SMES) system available in both three parameters and eight parameters problems are reported to showcase the usefulness of the proposed approach.},

	abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the domain of computer science that focuses on the development of machines that operate like humans. In the field of AI, medical disease detection is an instantly growing domain of research. In the past years, numerous endeavours have been made for the improvements of medical disease detection, because the errors and problems in medical disease detection cause serious wrong medical treatment. Meta-heuristic techniques have been frequently utilized for the detection of medical diseases and promise better accuracy of perception and prediction of diseases in the domain of biomedical. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) is a swarm-based intelligent stochastic search technique encouraged from the intrinsic manner of bee swarm during the searching of their food source. Consequently, for the versatility of numerical experimentation, PSO has been mostly applied to address the diverse kinds of optimization problems. However, the PSO techniques are frequently adopted for the detection of diseases but there is still a gap in the comparative survey. This paper presents an insight into the diagnosis of medical diseases in health care using various PSO approaches. This study presents to deliver a systematic literature review of current PSO approaches for knowledge discovery in the field of disease detection. The systematic analysis discloses the potential research areas of PSO strategies as well as the research gaps, although, the main goal is to provide the directions for future enhancement and development in this area. This paper gives a systematic survey of this conceptual model for the advanced research, which has been explored in the specified literature to date. This review comprehends the fundamental concepts, theoretical foundations, and conventional application fields. It is predicted that our study will be beneficial for the researchers to review the PSO algorithms in-depth for disease detection. Several challenges that can be undertaken to move the field forward are discussed according to the current state of the PSO strategies in health care.},

	abstract = {Modern greenhouse climate control requires use of advanced climate-control models; however, adoption of advanced climate-control models in today’s industrial greenhouse production is hindered by the shortcoming of existing climate-control systems to support non-invasive composition of independently-developed climatecontrol models. Despite the fact that adoption of advanced climate-control models allows growers to optimize their production through improved energy efficiency, improved plant quality and yield as well as reduced risks for various climate-related diseases, commercial vendors of industrial greenhouse-climate-control systems have not taken action to provide the necessary support for independent extensibility in their systems so far. Present climate-control systems require the control logic of independently-developed climate-control models to be merged into a single monolithic climate-control model. Hence, addition of new climate-control models requires modification and validation of this monolithic model. In this paper, we present a new approach to extensible greenhouse climate control that allows new climate-control models to be added dynamically to the climate-control system independently of each other. There is no need for merging models into a single monolithic model, as the approach allows independently-developed models to coexist alongside each other. The novelty of the approach is the use of a genetic algorithm to compute a balanced greenhouse climate that satisfies the multiobjective-optimization problem defined by the independently-added climate-control models. Feasibility of the approach is demonstrated through simulation of a number of selected production scenarios using a generic greenhouse simulator. The results of the simulations clearly show that the approach finds a balanced greenhouse climate that is satisfactory to the requirements of the independent climate-control models.},

Magetan Regency plans to support Indonesia in reducing emissions by 20\% by 2040 by analysing and mitigating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions generated by the transportation sector. The analysis was conducted by calculating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions based on traffic volume survey data and calculating the fuel oil (BBM) used to obtain the amounts of emissions generated. From the analysis, it was found that CO2 emissions generated by the transportation sector in Magetan Regency amounted to 3,105,318.08 tons/year in 2020 and had the potential to increase by 3.31\% per year. As mitigation actions, three activities are proposed, namely the use of public transportation, the movement of walking to school and greening. From the three actions, the total emissions are expected to be reduced by 1,422,516 tons/year or equivalent to 45\% reduction of total emissions if the three proposed activities are implemented. If this is implemented, Magetan Regency will be able to contribute 0.22\% of GHG emission reduction by 2040. If all districts in Indonesia also implement this mitigation, the transportation sector will contribute 9.15\% of the emission reduction in Indonesia in 2040.},

	abstract = {Manufacturing process accuracy is obtained by proper arrangement of ﬁxture elements known as ﬁxture layout. A N-3-2-1 method is used for sheet metals which requires (N + 3) ﬁxture elements to constrain deformation normal to surface. Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used for ﬁxture layout optimization, but it requires high computational effort due to large number of populations. A new method for ﬁxture layout optimization is proposed by integrating topology optimization into GA. In this method, topology optimization reduces the population for GA. The objective function is to reduce the population for GA and minimize total deformation normal to the plane of workpiece. The proposed approach comprised three stages. In the ﬁrst stage, the initial number of clamps are determined. In the second stage, the population is reduced for GA and the feasible area of clamps are identiﬁed using the topology optimization technique. In the third stage, the number and position of clamps, earlier identiﬁed in stage one, are optimized using GA. Two different case studies are solved by varying applied load position and magnitude. The proposed method results 47.5\% and 65\% decreases in the population for subcase 1 and subcase 2, respectively. However, in subcase 3 and subcase 4 the population reduced was 90\% and 80\%, respectively. The 25\% of reduced population is used as the convergence criteria. Similarly, total deformation normal to the plane is reduced in each subcase, with the highest reduction of 86.31\% in subcase 1 and lowest of 59.85\% in subcase 4. The experiment is performed on the ﬁrst case study to validate results. This concludes that the proposed method is valid and that optimal results are found.},

	abstract = {Mangroves are unique intertidal ecosystems that are experiencing high rates of deforestation throughout the world. Indonesia that has the highest mangrove cover in the world has lost its mangroves significantly in 1980s with the expansion of aquaculture development due to the increased shrimp price during the Asian economic crisis. Mangrove loss emits a significant amount of greenhouse gas to the atmosphere that contributes to the global warming. This study aims to estimate the extent of mangrove deforestation in Indonesia and the potential greenhouse gas emissions generated from mangrove deforestation in the last decade. We analyzed the land cover maps produced by the Indonesian Ministry of Environment and Forestry from 2009 to 2019 to calculate mangrove deforested areas as activity data. The average emission factor from mangrove deforestation is 136.9 MgCO2e ha-1yr-1, based on a meta-analysis from mangrove studies in Indonesia. Our result shows the total mangrove loss in the period of 2009 – 2019 covers an estimated area of 182,091 ha. The spatial analysis suggests that the main drivers of mangrove deforestation were derived from conversion of mangroves to low vegetated areas, aquaculture and agriculture practices. Mangrove deforestation potentially generates a significant amount of 182.6 MtonCO2e to the atmosphere within 10 years. If mangrove loss continues, a significant amount of greenhouse gases will be accumulated in the atmosphere and negatively affect their unique biodiversity. Halting mangrove deforestation and conserving the remaining mangrove forests is the most cost effective and efficient measure to reduce CO2 emissions and mitigate climate change.},

	abstract = {Mangrove forests are important carbon sinks, and this is especially true for Indonesia where about 24\% of the world's mangroves exist. Unfortunately, vast expanses of these mangroves have been deforested, degraded or converted to other uses resulting in significant greenhouse gas emissions. The objective of this study was to quantify the climate change mitigation potential of mangrove conservation and restoration in Indonesia. We calculated the emission factors from the dominant land uses in mangroves, determined mangrove deforestation rates and quantified the total emissions and the potential emission reductions that could be achieved from mangrove conservation and restoration. Based on our analysis of the carbon stocks and emissions from land use in mangroves we found: (1) Indonesia's mangrove ecosystem carbon stocks are among the highest of any tropical forest type; (2) mangrove deforestation results in greenhouse gas emissions that far exceed that of upland tropical deforestation; (3) in the last decade the rates of deforestation in Indonesian mangroves have remained high; and (4) conservation and restoration of mangroves promise to sequester significant quantities of carbon. While mangroves comprise only ≈2.6\% of Indonesia's total forest area, their degradation and deforestation accounted for ≈10\% of total greenhouse gas emissions arising from the forestry sector. The large source of greenhouse gas emissions from a relatively small proportion of the forest area underscores the value for inclusion of mangroves as a natural climate solution. Mangrove conservation is far more effective than mangrove restoration in carbon emissions reductions and an efficient pathway to achieve Indonesia's nationally determined contribution (NDC) targets. The potential emission reduction from halting deforestation of primary and secondary mangroves coupled with restoration activities could result in an emission reduction equivalent to 8\% of Indonesia's 2030 NDC emission reduction targets from the forestry sector.},

	abstract = {As the world’s largest archipelago and straddles the equator, and as one of the largest Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emitters in the world, Indonesia is very vulnerable to climate change. This fourth most populous country has experienced extreme climate events such as floods and droughts, as well as long-term impacts from rising sea levels. Seven, out of ten disasters in Indonesia are hydrometeorological disasters or climate change-related. In line with the increase in population, natural disasters affected by climate change have a wider impact on people and their assets, making it difficult for them to get out of poverty. This is a challenge for SDGs implementation in Indonesia. Government has thus been making efforts to reconcile sustainable development and mitigation policy to reduce Green House Gas Emission (GHG) in various sectors. However, there is no evidence for strategic government communications in delivering its policy due to lack coordination and integration among institutions and their understanding of the value of messaging development in disseminating its policy to increase public awareness. Additionally, the research on climate change communication of mitigation policy is limited. This study attempts to explore the flow of communication actions on the said climate its communication barriers. From interviews with government officials, this research shows that strategic management function must be provided government communication is to strengthen the climate change national policy to SDGs implementation.},

A modiﬁcation based on the age of the ant is introduced to standard ant colony optimization, called modiﬁed aging ant colony optimization (AACO). The AACO was implemented in association with grid-based modeling for the static and dynamic environments to solve the path planning problem. The simulations are run in the MATLAB environment to test the validity of the proposed algorithms. Simulations showed that the proposed path planning algorithms result in superior performance by ﬁnding the shortest and the most free-collision path under various static and dynamic scenarios.

	abstract = {Climate change mitigation policy has a strong inﬂuence on policy processes in worldwide. Indonesia as a developing country has committed to reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 29 percent by the year 2030. This calls into question the extent of how the cities or local governments can cope with the challenges of the current transport sector climate change mitigation in Bandung City. This paper aims to assess the governance context of climate policies in Bandung City and support further co-benefits. The preliminary stage of study shows that the policies in reducing GHG emissions are not in accordance with what was written by the government. The provincial and local government was aware that the stipulation delivered by the central government regarding mitigation on climate change stated in the regulation both in provincial and local level. Based on the actor‟s characteristic, the policies that encourage to reduce GHG emissions drive as a multi-actor interaction process namely The Paratransit, Trans Metro Bandung (TMB) and Vehicle Emissions Test. The research design involved an empirical case study on governance and policy relevant to climate change efforts to lower GHG in Bandung City, Indonesia. The analytical framework used for this analysis is the Governance Assessment Tool and the co-benefits approach. Data collection involved semi-structured interviews, a review of policy documents, and secondary quantitative data. The results reveal that the governance qualities create a context that there still are some limits, although several improvements have shown the positive trend at the local level. This is due to the qualities of the extent aspect as a low to moderate, the flexibility as a restrictive, and the coherence and intensity as moderate. The assessment of the criteria of co-benefits is more relevant to the public transport. The TMB has met all of the criteria of co-benefits. Thus, this TMB program has the highest impact to attain the co-benefits. The paratransit has the positive value of the criteria for lowering GHG emissions, energy and environmental sustainability, and development goals. The vehicle emission test met the criteria of sustainability and technical feasibility.},

	abstract = {Given the China’s fast-evolving aviation market, a reliable carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions forecast is essential to identify and mitigate the environmental impact of aviation market. Due to slot limits and airport capacity constraints in Shanghai, the rate of trafﬁc growth has slowed down in recent years. However, the increasing number of regional and international ﬂights tends to drive the fuel consumption and carbon emissions to an unexpectedly high level. This study uses a two-tiered bottom-up emissions prediction method for empirically estimating and forecasting air transport CO2 emissions on all the passenger ﬂights to/from Shanghai. The Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) linear model was applied for a 5-year prediction of air transport fuel consumption and en route CO2 emissions. The research established that 36.49 million tonnes of CO2 will be emitted into the atmosphere by the end of June 2021, representing a 6.41\% increase compared to the same period a year earlier. Market-based recommendations are proposed including a nationwide carbon market and a carbon offset scheme, accordingly.},

The paper estimated three panel models comprising the components of greenhouse gasses which includes nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide (CO2), and methane and examined their relationship with economic growth and energy consumption. The findings of the study showed evidence of a positive impact of economic growth on both CO2 and methane emissions in the long run. Its impact on nitrous oxide emissions although positive was found to be statistically insignificant. Energy consumption was also found to produce an insignificant positive impact on CO2, methane, and nitrous oxide emissions in the long run. In the short run, economic growth exerts a significant positive effect on methane emissions; however, its effect on CO2 and nitrous oxide emissions although positive was found to be statistically insignificant. Energy consumption produces an insignificant impact on all components of greenhouse gasses in the short run. In addition, our empirical results showed the presence of a non-linear relationship between methane emissions and economic growth, confirming the existence of the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) only in the case of methane emissions model.},

The empirical ﬁndings suggest that in the long run, bidirectional Granger causality between energy consumption, GDP and greenhouse gas emissions and between GDP, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption is established. A non-linear, quadratic relationship is revealed between greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and economic growth, consistent with the environmental Kuznets curve for these 16 Asian countries and a subsample of the Asian new industrial economy. Short-run relationships are regionally speciﬁc across the Asian continent. From the viewpoint of energy policy in Asia, various governments support low-carbon or renewable energy use and are reducing fossil fuel combustion to sustain economic growth, but in some countries, evidence suggests that energy conservation might only be marginal.},

	abstract = {In the current era of globalization, a clean environment remains a crucial factor for the health of the population. Thus, improving air quality is a major focus of environmental policies, as it affects all aspects of nature, including humans. For these reasons, it is appropriate to take into account the health risks posed by greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions released into the atmosphere. With regard to global GHG emissions, there are concerns about the loss of protection of the ozone layer and it is very likely that climate change can be expected, which multiplies the environmental threat and has potentially serious global consequences. In this regard, it is important to pay increased attention to emissions that enter the atmosphere, which include countless toxic substances. The aim of this study was to examine the associations between selected GHG emissions and the health of the European Union (EU) population represented by disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). This aim was achieved using several analytical procedures (descriptive analysis, correlation analysis, cluster analysis, and panel regression analysis), which included ﬁve environmental variables (carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) in CO2 equivalent, nitrous oxide (N2O) in CO2 equivalent, hydroﬂuorocarbons (HFC) in CO2 equivalent, sulfur hexaﬂuoride (SF6) in CO2 equivalent) and one health variable (DALYs). An emphasis was placed on the use of quantitative methods. The results showed that CO2 emissions have a dominant position among selected GHG emissions. The revealed positive link between CO2 and DALYs indicated that a decrease in CO2 may be associated with a decrease in DALYs, but it is also true that this cannot be done without reducing emissions of other combustion products. In terms of CO2, the least positive scores were observed in Luxembourg and Estonia. Germany had the lowest score of DALYs, representing the most positive health outcome in the EU. In terms of total GHG emissions, Ireland and Luxembourg were considered to be less positive countries compared to the other analyzed countries. Countries should focus on reducing GHG emissions in general, but from a health point of view, reducing CO2 emissions seems to be the most beneﬁcial.},

	abstract = {The main purpose of this study was to predict Turkey’s future greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions using an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN) model trained by a grey wolf optimizer (GWO) algorithm. Gross domestic product, energy consumption, population, urbanization rate, and renewable energy production data were used as predictor variables. To probe the accuracy of the proposed model, the new ANN-GWO model’s performance was compared with the performance of ANNBP (back propagation), ANN-ABC (artiﬁcial bee colony), and ANN-TLBO (teaching–learning-based optimization) models using multiple error criteria. According to calculated error values, the ANN-GWO models predicted GHG emissions more accurately than classical ANN-BP, ANN-ABC, and ANN-TLBO models. According to the average relative error values calculated for the test set, ANN-GWO performs 32.23\% better than ANN-BP, 35.29\% better than ANN-ABC, and 19.33\% better than ANN-TLBO. Using the ANN-GWO model, GHG emissions were forecasted out to 2030 under three different scenarios. The predictions obtained, consistent with a prior forecasting study in the literature, indicated that GHG emissions are expected to outpace ofﬁcial predictions (model prediction range for 2030, 956.97–1170.54 Mt CO2 equivalent). The present study demonstrated that GHG emissions can be predicted accurately with an ANN-GWO model, and that the GWO optimization method is advantageous for predicting future GHG emissions.},

	abstract = {Recently, the numerical optimization field has attracted the research community to propose and develop various metaheuristic optimization algorithms. This paper presents a new metaheuristic optimization algorithm called Honey Badger Algorithm (HBA). The proposed algorithm is inspired from the intelligent foraging behavior of honey badger, to mathematically develop an efficient search strategy for solving optimization problems. The dynamic search behavior of honey badger with digging and honey finding approaches are formulated into exploration and exploitation phases in HBA. Moreover, with controlled randomization techniques, HBA maintains ample population diversity even towards the end of the search process. To assess the efficiency of HBA, 24 standard benchmark functions, CEC’17 test-suite, and four engineering design problems are solved. The solutions obtained using the HBA have been compared with ten well-known metaheuristic algorithms including Simulated annealing (SA), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Covariance Matrix Adaptation Evolution Strategy (CMA-ES), Success-History based Adaptive Differential Evolution variants with linear population size reduction (L-SHADE), Moth-flame Optimization (MFO), Elephant Herding Optimization (EHO), Whale Optimization Algorithm (WOA), Grasshopper Optimization Algorithm (GOA), Thermal Exchange Optimization (TEO) and Harris hawks optimization (HHO). The experimental results, along with statistical analysis, reveal the effectiveness of HBA for solving optimization problems with complex search-space, as well as, its superiority in terms of convergence speed and exploration–exploitation balance, as compared to other methods used in this study. The source code of HBA is currently available for public at https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/98204-honeybadger-algorithm.},

	abstract = {With the increase in greenhouse gas emissions, climate change is occurring in the atmosphere. Although the energy production for Turkey is increased at a high rate, the greenhouse gas emissions are still high currently. Problems that seem to be very complex can be predicted with different algorithms without difficulty. Due to fact that artificial intelligence is often included in the studies to evaluate the solution performance and make comparisons with the obtained solutions. In this study, machine learning algorithms are used to compare and predict greenhouse gas emissions. Methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and fluorinated gases (F-gases) are considered direct greenhouse gases originating from the agriculture and waste sectors, energy, industrial processes, and product use, within the scope of greenhouse gas emission statistics. Compared to different machine learning methods, support vector machines can be considered an advantageous estimation method since they can generalize more details. On the other hand, the artificial neural network algorithm is one of the most commonly used machine learning algorithms in terms of classification, optimization, estimation, regression, and pattern tracking. From this point of view, this study aims to predict greenhouse gas emissions using artificial neural network algorithms and support vector machines by estimating CO2, CH4, N2O, and F-gases from greenhouse gases. The data set was obtained from the Turkish Statistical Institute and the years are included between 1990 and 2019. All analyzes were performed using MATLAB version 2019b software.},

This paper discusses how metaheuristic algorithms are being applied to solve diﬀerent optimization problems in the area of bioinformatics. While the text provides references to many optimization problems in the area, it focuses on those that have attracted more interest from the optimization community. Among the problems analyzed, the paper discusses in more detail the molecular docking problem, the protein structure prediction, phylogenetic inference, and diﬀerent string problems. In addition, references to other relevant optimization problems are also given, including those related to medical imaging or gene selection for classiﬁcation.

	abstract = {This study proposes the Fire Hawk Optimizer (FHO) as a novel metaheuristic algorithm based on the foraging behavior of whistling kites, black kites and brown falcons. These birds are termed Fire Hawks considering the specific actions they perform to catch prey in nature, specifically by means of setting fire. Utilizing the proposed algorithm, a numerical investigation was conducted on 233 mathematical test functions with dimensions of 2–100, and 150,000 function evaluations were performed for optimization purposes. For comparison, a total of ten different classical and new metaheuristic algorithms were utilized as alternative approaches. The statistical measurements include the best, mean, median, and standard deviation of 100 independent optimization runs, while well-known statistical analyses, such as Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Wilcoxon, Mann–Whitney, Kruskal–Wallis, and Post-Hoc analysis, were also conducted. The obtained results prove that the FHO algorithm exhibits better performance than the compared algorithms from literature. In addition, two of the latest Competitions on Evolutionary Computation (CEC), such as CEC 2020 on bound constraint problems and CEC 2020 on real-world optimization problems including the well-known mechanical engineering design problems, were considered for performance evaluation of the FHO algorithm, which further demonstrated the superior capability of the optimizer over other metaheuristic algorithms in literature. The capability of the FHO is also evaluated in dealing with two of the real-size structural frames with 15 and 24 stories in which the new method outperforms the previously developed metaheuristics.},

	abstract = {This work proposes a new meta-heuristic called Grey Wolf Optimizer (GWO) inspired by grey wolves (Canis lupus). The GWO algorithm mimics the leadership hierarchy and hunting mechanism of grey wolves in nature. Four types of grey wolves such as alpha, beta, delta, and omega are employed for simulating the leadership hierarchy. In addition, the three main steps of hunting, searching for prey, encircling prey, and attacking prey, are implemented. The algorithm is then benchmarked on 29 well-known test functions, and the results are veriﬁed by a comparative study with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), Gravitational Search Algorithm (GSA), Differential Evolution (DE), Evolutionary Programming (EP), and Evolution Strategy (ES). The results show that the GWO algorithm is able to provide very competitive results compared to these well-known meta-heuristics. The paper also considers solving three classical engineering design problems (tension/compression spring, welded beam, and pressure vessel designs) and presents a real application of the proposed method in the ﬁeld of optical engineering. The results of the classical engineering design problems and real application prove that the proposed algorithm is applicable to challenging problems with unknown search spaces.},

Researches and developers are trying to make machines and software's more efficient and intelligent. This is where the Artificial Intelligence plays its role in developing efficient and optimal searching algorithm solutions. Genetic algorithm is one of most pervasive and advanced developed heuristic search technique in AI. Genetic algorithm (GA) is developed to find the most optimized solution for a given problem based on inheritance, mutation, selection and some other techniques. It was proved that genetic algorithms are the most powerful unbiased optimization techniques for sampling a large solution space. In this paper, we have used GA for the image optimization and Knapsack Problems, which are commonly found in a real world scenario. Furthermore, a research based on a tool that uses Genetic Algorithm, called the GA Playground is done to demonstrate the capability of solving the Knapsack Problem with the fitness function and a case study on how images can be reproduced using the optimal parameters. Lastly, a few methods such as the Hash Table and the Taguchi Method are suggested to improve the performance of the Genetic Algorithm.},

	abstract = {Traditionally, project scheduling and environmental impact assessment are carried out separately which is ill-suited for modern organizations as creating a project plan that optimizes for environmental goals can have an adverse effect on project time and resource utilization efficiency. This study aims to address this issue by considering project time, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource-leveling objectives simultaneously. Multi-objective Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm has been modified by incorporating genetic operators and a local search heuristic and its performance was compared with the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm II on six assessment metrics. The computational experiments exhibited that the modified multi-objective Grey Wolf Optimization algorithm outdid the non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm on five out of six assessment metrics. Two case studies have been used to demonstrate the applicability and validity of the presented model. In the obtained Pareto front solutions for the real-life case study, the range of time, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource deviation have been 594–835 (days), 19,870,953.1-20,938,469.6 (kgCO2-e) and 67,204.93-141,915.55 (unitless) respectively. The examination of tradeoffs between objectives showed that greenhouse gas emissions can be decreased if the makespan and resource deviation are allowed a slight increase at various decision points. The presented model can help practitioners and researchers make practical tradeoffs between the conflicting goals of duration, greenhouse gas emissions, and resource optimization.},

For data collection, Kitchenham’s technique were used to select and filter the literature, at the first iteration, 1,167 papers were found. After applying inclusion and exclusion criteria, 101 articles were processed for text mining. Titles and abstracts were analyzed using a text-mining tool, and then resulted clusters of words. Afterwards, clusters of words were labeled using facet analysis. This study results in eight interrelated clusters of academic achievement factors: demography, internal consistency, technology, student course engagement, activity in a classroom, educational system, socio-culture, and personality. Several insights into each cluster will be described and might be beneficial for researchers in learning analytics.},

	abstract = {Digitalization and the development of information technology, especially Artificial Intelligence, have been embraced in all fields. At the same time, data has grown mostly from the digital footprints or any technology information system. The development of technology and big data offers enormous opportunities to conduct big data analytics in any field, including education. This study aims to review current research related to big data analytics in education and explain future research direction. Using Kitchenham's technique, we selected and clustered the literature into the types of data, methods, type of data analytics and learning analytics application used. The results show that research of big data learning analytics generally aims to improve the learning process, analyze learner behaviour for student profiling, improve student retention and evaluate student feedback in the context of MOOCs and Learning Management System. Several future directions for this topic are: 1) building a big open dataset including data pre-processing and addressing the problem of imbalanced dataset, 2) process mining for learning log activity to gain knowledge and insights from online behaviour, not only from the perspective of the learner but also from the activities of the teacher, 3) designing an automated framework which uses big data and allows descriptive, predictive, prescriptive analytical learning to be carried out. To summarize, embracing big data to learning analytics and educational data mining is an open research area that seems very powerful in education.},
